Abbott Northwestern Hospital,Minneapolis,MN,Anonymous,4,5,3.5,5,5,-,-,-,-,-,Syndicated Review,"Worked on the GI/GU Med Surg floor and absolutely loved it here. Good ratios 1:4 on days and 1:6 on night. Staff on the unit was so helpful and kind. Big hospital with many resources including IV team, RRT team, Code Team, RTs, and phlebotomy. Hospital location is not the safest but parked in the parking ramp and had a walkway over there which was nice. Floated to other MedSurg units as needed.",https://app.scrubstr.com/,"August 26, 2023"
Abraham Lincoln Memorial Hospital,Lincoln,IL,Anonymous,4,5,5,2,4,-,-,-,-,-,Syndicated Review,"Soldotna is a small sleepy town where people go to retire. Very safe town, i usually leave my car unlocked and nothing has ever happened. The hospital is surprisingly busy for how small the town is. Med surg is 38 beds with an overflow unit that is sometimes open, up to 43. ICU has 10 beds and their ICU is more like step down. The only place you could float to as med surg is ED for holds and that usually doesn’t happen. There’s RT and phleb 24/7, never had to draw my own labs which is nice. Staff are pretty friendly and most have been there a long time, you’ll only find 1-2 new grads. Ratios on nights have ranged anywhere from 4 to sometimes 7 or 8. Usually it’s a max of 6 but they never stop admitting even if there isn’t staff. There is 1 charge for the entire med surg unit. Sometimes they have 1 or 2 patients but they usually are a free charge. Most of the staff don’t take lunches, they keep their vocera on them while they eat. Sometimes the CNAs are properly staffed but sometimes not and you might have to get your own vitals and glu poc. It’s a med surg tele unit but there’s a tele tech that’s monitoring and usually only 1 or 2 of my patients were actually on tele. Most of your patients are 70-80-90 year old full codes, a lot of COPD and CHF. Have only encountered 1 or 2 drug addicts. There’s a few staff that are ultrasound trained which is nice when you have a hard stick. There’s no pharmacy on nights so sometimes you have to override meds or have the house sup pull it for you if it’s a new patient. Doctors are usually nice and give you what you need. Overall mostly positive experience.",https://app.scrubstr.com/,"December 13, 2022"

Night shift assistant managers could not give a damn about your schedule and I was often scheduled on/off and worked every weekend for one of the three months I was there even though standard was every other weekend. Some travel nurses didn’t have to work weekend shifts. I was also in school and they could not care less whether you have an exam or not. It wasn’t a terrible experience however I was ready to be DONE. RNs are expected to do everything for patient except baths. This includes: sugars, labs, &vitals on all 5 patients. Patient population is mainly geriatric on this ortho floor and most of the 9/10 times your entire team will need morning labs and all are diabetics so essentially you are nonstop on your feet from 2-6am giving round the clock pain meds, doing vitals, sugars, and labs with no help.

Adventist Health Lodi Memorial Hospital,Lodi,CA,Anonymous,4,2.5,3.5,-,-,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"Traveler friendly (at least in the ED). Staff is very approachable and helpful. Tough to rate the ED as a whole because there were a few major drawbacks. If you are lobby nurse, you are responsible for upwards of 20 + patients at a time. These patients don’t always get rooms and you are responsible for all tasks. If you were in a patient assignment it could be better but there was not any differentiation for acuity. If you had sick patients together, well then you had sick patients together. No down sizing ratios if you had an ICU patient (which is actually required according to California law). Always got 30 minute lunch break but never got the 2 fifteen minute breaks (also required by law). The pluses: very friendly staff, a lot of ancillary support (they have phlebotomy staff draw all labs!) RT readily available. Techs take all patients to floor (even tele patients) except for PTU (step down) and ICU patients which the nurse must accompany. Techs are hard workers and very helpful. Didn’t meet anyone that wasn’t helpful and friendly. Lots of supplies readily available. IV pumps could be difficult to come by at times. ED physicians were great, hospitalists not so much.

I extended for 6 months and hated to leave, but I needed to take an actual travel contract (this was local for me). They are supposed to be switching to epic at some point? But still using cerner unfortunately. Majority of the ER docs are amazing and are big into communication between the nursing staff. Ratio is 1:4. They are a level II trauma but very rarely see it. They do have a pediatric inpatient unit and PICU (although it’s 4 beds and is often ‘closed’) so we did see a decent amount of pediatric patients. If you work day shift you will have the luxury of an abundance of ER techs. Night shift, you’re lucky if you have one pass 11 pm. But they were all great and super proactive.

Alaska Native Medical Center - Anmc,Anchorage,AK,Anonymous,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"Working at ANMC was a mixed bag. A lot of the staff I worked with were very friendly and helpful, especially those that checked in/came over to assist from ICU. This PCU is sort of part of ICU in that it is under the umbrella of their management and so most staffing decisions are made in conjunction with ICU. In addition, the ICU charge is essentially in charge of higher level decisions, so charging on this unit is a bit of a joke since you're taking two of your own patients and there are only eight patients in total. The patients vacillate between essentially ICU-level patients that the intensifies refuse to move across the hall and SNF patients that can't be placed due to extreme issues with skilled nursing and assisted living facility availability in Alaska as a whole. Unfortunately, because of the nature of this unit being a part of ICU, most of the staff members are very open with the fact that this unit is merely a stepping stone to moving to ICU and they've even designed their new grad and precepting program to have nurses work their way towards being critical care trained by doing online modules for several months while staffing the unit. As a result, there isn't much tethering anyone to the unit and it feels like a revolving door of staff every shift. Nothing you ever need is stocked and the central supply staff are short handed every day and forget to send about fifty percent of what you request to be sent up. This often happens when surgery residents show up unannounced with requests for random supplies for dressing changes, an experience I had far too frequently on this unit. The unit in general feels disorganized and poorly managed. Nursing instructors will often drop off students without warning, so expect to precept students often as a traveller. There are also a lot of new grads that will be sent over on their own to work without a preceptor only a few weeks into their residency programs, so please be aware that you will need to keep your ears and eyes open to give them a hand. Most of the staff I've interacted with are incredibly nice and welcoming but you are going to need to accept a lot of responsibility for this place when you sign a contract in this unit. In terms of organization, there are four single rooms and two double rooms. None of the rooms have computers in them and there are COWs in the hallway you can claim as your station for the day. There is one small desk that serves as the nursing station with three computers, one of which is claimed by the clerk (about 25% there was no one available to clerk though, so expect to answer your own phone calls and call lights), one is for the charge, and the third is often used by doctors charging on the unit. On the other side of the desk is the two bed dialysis unit and patients are able to look into the nursing station from those spots. There is a med room with a pyxis and a supply pyxis. There is another supply room with a cart and another supply pyxis. Right as you walk in, there is a small area partitioned off as nutrition room and a jumble of equipment that has no designated spot to be stored except for right in the hallway where visitors enter the unit. Also, there is no break room for this unit so you're expected to store your things and lunch across the hall in the ICU. In general, as much as it doesn't sound like it, I have enjoyed this contract but I have been extremely frustrated by the lack of organization.",https://app.scrubstr.com/,"December 6, 2022"
Alaska Native Medical Center - Anmc,Anchorage,AK,Anonymous,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"I really enjoyed my experience at ANMC! I was on 4W which was ortho / med surg. I usually had 4 patients, but never more than 5. The staff were great, always very willing to answer questions and help out. There was also a large traveler community that all got along well and supported each other. ANMC is specifically for Native Alaskan people and has a lot of other programs that support health and wellbeing of Natives across the state that I thought was really cool. They also set up housing and travel arrangements for patients and family members when they come in from out of town. Very different than any other hospital I've worked at but a great learning experience. The biggest plus was being in Anchorage. Being the biggest city in AK, travel is super accessible to anywhere in the state. AK is one of the most beautiful places I've ever visited and I went on so many epic adventures! 10/10 recommend. A few cons: I was floated about 50% of my shifts, usually either to other med surg units or ER holds, but a few times to L+D and peds. The only way to get a hold of providers was to have the charge nurse secure message them. Also they were just in the process of instating a color coded scrub dress code when I was leaving.

Aurora St Lukes Medical Center,Milwaukee,WI,Anonymous,3,3,5,1,1,,,,,,Telemetry/Step-down — Syndicated Review,"I will NEVER go back to this hospital. This hospital treats their staff like actual garbage. Constantly mandating overtime, and this includes minutes notice. I watched a nurse get told 5 minutes before shift end that she was being required to stay an additional 4 hours. Forcing staff out of orientation that aren’t ready. Not adequately staffing units because “you’ve worked with less nurses before.” Meanwhile night shift nurses are getting NINE patients, NINE. most patients are total cares. The OR has sent patients up that are NOT appropriate for this specific floor (ie: we weren’t the ICU) and then the patient died within an hour of arrival on the unit. When staff went to leadership to make complaints and find solutions the unit leadership said, “I’m burnt out too. Not sure how to help.” The staff I worked with were incredibly unprofessional, disrespectful, petty, unkind, and were very unwilling to help other staff members. Part of this I will contribute to them being burnt out from being mandated multiple times a week and severe understaffing. Nurses/CNAs would refuse to answer a call light unless it was their own. Nurses would dump the dirty work on the CNAs. “Hey room 5 soiled the bed, can you clean them up?”Nurses and CNAs would bully specific staff members just because they didn’t like them. They would give people they didn’t like the hardest patients or the patient with the most cares. Nurses used SLURS in front of patients. I listened to a nurse accuse a student of “making up sexual harassment for attention” when a patient attempted to assault the student. Staff members do not know how to interact with patients that have mental health issues (I watched a charge nurse egg on a patient with schizophrenia right before shift change.) I could continue to go on. As for the doctors. Some of the doctors are great and kind to staff, but honestly, they’re few and far between. First to get a hold of a doctor is near impossible. There are about 5 different ways to contact them and none of them are emergent or urgent notices. I called an RRT on a patient and it took TWO HOURS for their provider to show up. Half the time they ignore your messages. The other half of the time they either write a rude response or call you to bark orders at you. If they call you, you likely can’t hear them because they will call you when they’re in the car and you’re on speaker phone. They’re in the car because they work at several hospitals in the area, not just St. Luke’s. Rarely do they attempt to keep nurses in the loop for plans. Doctors who are the primary doctor of the patient during the hospitalization refuse to assess or treat them because “Well, Cardiology is on. Contact them, not me”. Meanwhile, there is no cardiology doc signed in and no way to figure out who to contact. Then when you try to have a conversation with the doctors about your concerns about the patient, they are rude, dismissive, and condescending. I will never return to this hospital. I will not risk my license for this place. Save yourself the trouble and just say no.",https://app.scrubstr.com/,"December 4, 2022"

CNAs are extremely rude and would give you attitude if you delegated BASIC tasks like VS. I do as best as I can, but I am running around while they are sitting and on their phones. They would ask ""why"" every time you ask them to do something. I've heard CNAs say that if they don't get around to the task and if something happens to the patient, it is the NURSES fault and its on the NURSE'S license. What kind of attitude is this? Teamwork is a rarity at this facility. Also, there was an incredible shortage on supplies (med cups, IV flushes, primary and secondary tubing, gauze, telemetry leads, 20/22 gauge needles, heparin needles, alcohol wipes, ect). I would spend at least an HOUR looking for supplies either from central supply or other floors. It got so bad that I went down to central supply and grabbed items and stocked our floor itself. You know it's bad when staff gate-keeps and hide supplies for themselves because of the shortage. Not only that, the ratios can get pretty insane. This floor takes insulin gtts, because of this, you have to check the patients BS every hour (which at most facilities you either get lesser patients or this is an automatic ICU transfer because of the frequency you need to be in the patients room). I had to take 2 admissions, went up to 7 patients and had two patients on gtts (insulin and heparin). It is the nurses duty to titrate and place orders in for the heparin gtt. INCREDIBLY UNSAFE. Most nights it is 1:6 ratio. At one point it was 1:7/8 nurse to patient ratio before they hired in more travelers. You do get a hospitalist at night that will page back pretty quickly and most place in their own orders. Most of the time they do listen to their nurses. Unless you get an internal med doctor. I had one yell at me because I didn't know how to place the orders on epic. I didn't know because it was an order set panel and the internal med doctor would hang up on me before I was done speaking.

TNICU and MICU share staffing, so their core nurses are somewhat “cross-trained;” although the specialties have obvious differences. There is no intensivist on-site at night for critical care or neuro crit patients—only for the trauma patients. Need orders? Expect to call an off-site call center to get orders from providers who aren’t visualizing your patients. One charge RN across the two units with, if staffed, a clinical/resource charge for each. Charge nurses with minimal nurse experience over a level 1 trauma ICU and over 40 beds total between the two larger ICUs. ICUs will desperately request overtime staffing just to float 5 of their nurses (travelers first) to stepdown, the ED, etc. The whole hospital is short-staffed; and as an ICU nurse, expect to fill those holes. There is no rule about how many patients an ICU nurse can accept when floated. Most of my concerns come from decisions of administration. Few staff nurses at BDMC were unfriendly. I will always advocate that most of those nurses were too hardworking to be accepting the bare minimum from a mega hospital system like Banner, especially with lots of other hospital systems in the area. Sadly, many didn’t even recognize how unsafe their working environment was because they appreciated having so much “autonomy”. BDMC is a nice hospital with great technologies. In fact, they did some things very well that I’d love to see back home. But it’s just not appropriately resourced for as many patients as they accept and for having the busiest ER in the state.

Patient acuity within your assignment makes it difficult to give even decent care from seasoned nurses. The night shift NP Gloria refuses to order necessary treatments/meds for declining patients… orders nurses to put narc orders in & when you refuse she simply states, “I guess they won’t get the medication then.” Doctors was constantly rude/argumentative. Most units are COMPLETELY staffed by travelers and without charges and just try to make the best of it. CNAs will take unstable vitals (68/31) & move on to the next patient… 1.5 hr they’ll chart the vitals…. So you better be checking in constantly with them. The town itself has a lot to do, however downtown is known to be a little dangerous at night. Cafeteria closes at 7 but they keep the grill open and that was probably the best part. Don’t waste your time trying to complete their 8 hr orientation at home from your computer, it didn’t work for ANY of us & we were all trying to use the 3 computers available at the hospital Monday morning. I enjoyed the other travelers and the few staff members I met. Often ED will roll patients to the floor before you’ve taken report. Very disrespectful doctors, NP & ED. Expect to float every night. call for orders that should already be placed. Stop what your doing to Recheck your vitals often. Deal with ALOT of pressure wounds & to be looked at crazy when you ask the tech to help you turn a patient.

The hospital has a phlebotomy team that draws every single lab. The hospital uses EPIC documentation, they converted a few months ago. My schedule was better than my staff schedule, 3 days on 4-6 days off. Blocked scheduling when I changed my contract to 48 hours as well. The staff are very traveler friendly. Parking is free in the garage and around a three minute walk. They had appropriate PPE( N95’s, gowns, faceshields etc) for all Covid patients and rule out Covid patients. Their cafeteria closes early so I brought food on nightshift. They use omnicell for med dispensing. The patients here are some of the kindest patients I’ve ever met. I’m from NY and usually at least 2 of my patients per night were extremely rude and manipulative. Here almost every patient I’ve had has been very kind. I would definitely recommend traveling to this hospital. I stayed at the Hyatt house which is like full suites with a kitchen for $50/ night about 8 minutes away. Not the most ideal place to stay as there were some shady characters but very cheap. Eventually we moved to the “Waterwalk” and that place is amazing it’s basically fully furnished apartments for about $2500/month. If I had to rate my experience I’d give it a 9/10. There is so much good food here and shopping and people are very friendly. Highly recommend!",https://app.scrubstr.com/,"December 4, 2021"

The staff and management on the floor were amazing. All friendly, quick to jump in and help, and all knowledgeable. Ratios varied from 1:3-4, occasionally 5. I extended into the summer of 2022 and was placed on the COVID/pulmonary floor. Ratios there were always 1:5 on nights. I spent majority of my shifts during the extension floating to other floors, I probably worked less than 10 shifts on that unit. Staff there could be cliquy at times but also helpful and jumped in when needed. Each floor I went to always had PCAs who were very hands on and helpful. Charge does not usually take patients unless the unit is really understaffed, this only happened once when I floated. I can provide a list of all the floors I worked along with normal ratios. 2J (MedSurg): 1:4-5, one time I had 6. 3J (Med/Tele): 1:3-4 3H (Neuro/Tele): 1:3-5 6H/J (Ortho): 1:4-5 6T (Trauma): 1:4 8R (COVID/Pulmonary): 1:5 9R (MedSurg): 1:4-5 11R (Cardio/Tele): 1:3-4 13R (Cardio/Thoracic Transplant): 1:4-5 15R (Colorectal): 1:4 I also floated to the 3rd floor women’s oncology unit.

ED Hold for one shift, the ratio was 1:5. Was told to only take the patients waiting for admission, ended up with a few discharges and patients not getting admitted. I was with a bunch of newer ER nurses who told me they had just come off orientation 1-2 weeks before.

Necessary machinary usually broken i.e. EKG machines so best of luck when there's an emergency. Ratios on nights 1:7, often tried to push 1:8+. Nursing is as helpful and kind as they can be while managing their own assignments. The CNAs were the worst I've encountered in my career as a nurse: will flat refuse to do vitals and argue when asked, won't empty foleys, will change patients once a shift even if they were incontinent at the beginning of the night etc. You have to babysit them and usually get ignored when you make requests. It feels like primary nursing because of that. The floors usually run with 3 RNs and 1-2 CNAs which is insanity. It's hard to reach physicians and they usually don't care about your concerns until the patient is at the point of needing the ICU. Most of the staff is travelers now because of what's listed above. The problems go all the way up the chain to the CNOs who claim ""nursing is like this everywhere right now"" since they haven't seen bedside in years - they don't have the staffs back, are verbally aggressive when they raise valid concerns, and even cold shoulder them/treat them poorly when they decide to move to another job.

Not to mention they had a MICE and COCKROACH infestation (which the nurse educator admitted to when a mouse ran across the room during orientation, dust was also common to be seen showering down from the HVAC vents onto patients). Parking was free onsite for night shift. There was a discounted lot for $13/day offsite with shuttle for day shift. The ER administration seemed to be a tight female only clique that despised travel nurses. I've never seen such a narrow demographic of white liberal female nurses in their 20's (some even had satan/devil tattoos), creeeepy as phuck since their caring for vulnerable children. But Boston is known for its large Satanic following. Kind of ironic coming from a place that makes diversity a bigger priority than quality care. It was a teaching hospital so the residents tended to complicate things and make many unnecessary orders but they were very responsive. The doctors and nurses overall were nice and I got along well with accept for a select few. The hospital flaunts a leftist political agenda (i.e. pride, transgender, & BLM stickers everywhere). Most the doctors had Boston Children's issued rainbow Black Lives Matter ID badge lanyards which has no place in the workplace just as a Trump or Maga lanyard would be too. Also, the requirement to asking toddlers their pronouns and gender identity is child abuse IMO.

It has become the norm to have 4 patients if you don’t have vented ICU patients. You’re lucky if you have just three patients as a traveler. A staff member told us that we (travelers) are getting paid to take unsafe assignments. This staff member also acts in the capacity of charge nurse and house supervisor sometimes, and these are the people that make our assignments and decides who gets assigned admissions and transfers. There are a couple of staff members that are receptive and nice and helpful though. The ICU doctors are great and easy to get a hold of. If you don’t have an ICU patient, you have to page the Hospitalist and hope you get a call back. Supplies and equipment are hit or miss. They have some nice stuff that not all hospitals do, but they also lack some basic supplies. Overall, I don’t recommend working here.

Ratios were always 1-6 with Med Surg Tele receiving high acuity patients very often. Travelers are always floated, so if you contract with ICU or Tele, you will be floated every shift due to hospital not being able to retain permanent staff. They will ask you to pick up a shift for your unit then float you sometimes 3 times in a shift. Units are always understaffed. Usually PCTs are 1-25 with over half of that pt load being total care pts. Schedule is released to staff then changed multiple times without much notice. On my unit, night shift wasn't held accountable for ANYTHING. Day shift would arrive and IV abx that were due at 0400 hung but not started and given as well as 0500-0700 meds never given. They let PCTs on night shift make day shift patient nurse assignments. They let night shift PCTs check the crash cart. Management was made aware several times of the above but stated ""Its an ongoing issue we are aware"" after a year nothing was addressed. Day shift never gets 15 minute break nor a 30 minute lunch. Employee parking is a good 3/4 mile away, secluded, dark, no security, and there are issues constantly with cars being broken into, gas tanks being drained, and creepy notes being left on windshields. Security was made aware several times but there has been no changes. If you are physically assaulted by a pt, management will do absolutely nothing but apologize to the pt. ED is always grossly understaffed and the core staff they do have are new grads. ED will send respiratory pts to the floor without completing a respiratory panel. Lots of semi private rooms with barely enough room to fit an IV pole in. Hospital is always short of IV pumps, IV tubing, syringes, and basic supplies. The North tower is very outdated. Half of the wall O2 connectors are broke. Phlebotomy is understaffed so if you have a drip such as heparin with scheduled labs you have to collect them yourself BUT they refuse to stock blood collection tubes and the equipment for blood draws. They use Epic RNs wear royal blue They use Pyxis 3 North, 4 North, 1 West, 1 East are staffed with travelers, float pool, and nurses pulled from their unit. South tower is remodeled with ACU, CVU, ICU, ED, and OR North Tower (dilapidated) is 2 North (Tele), 1 West (isolation), 1 East (over flow with everything from Tele to dementia to psych) 3 North is Med Surg, 4 North is Med Surg Ortho, 5 North is Med Surg Neuro Charge nurses are usually in staffing with a pt load of 6 in all the North tower units. Elevators in North tower are down at least 50% of the time. On weekends, GI, Ortho, Neuro, Hematology/Oncology, Urology, Nephrology, Infectious Diseases do NOT have coverage. Cath lab, nuclear medicine does not work on Saturday and Sunday. Nuclear medicine does have 1 person cover the ED on weekends. There is transport from 0700-1800 after that the primary nurse has to provide transport anywhere the pt needs to go. Transfer admissions from another unit to your unit does not have a set amount of time they to wait before calling report and sending the pt to you. If the hospital is above 75% capacity, the ER does not have to wait the normal 20 minutes from the time the bed is assigned to call report and send the new admission to you. There is a 3 person IV access team to place midlines and PICC lines but they usually are working alone (only 1 working each day) so it can take up to 10-12 hours for them to come to bedside to place a line. IV therapy works 0800-2000 no nights. If you run out of a specific supply (such as primary IV tubing) and it's after 1530, you have to try to contact the house manager to get the supplies for you because the supply room for the hospital closes at 1530.

Night shift was 1:5 as a new grad but then they made a rule LPN 1:4 unless no other choice.

No tech Patient population: everyone’s got DM2 and CKD. Lots are alcoholics and drug users. Small area so you’ll rotate around frequent fliers in your time here quickly. ED maintains ALL psych holds. Cons: Small, old hospital, poor staffing. Like so poor during my contract they shut down an entire FLOOR. As in if you stop on the 2nd floor in the elevator, it’s spooky, lights out. That floor is still closed and haven’t been able to reopen for two months now. Some archaic practices and equipment. There’s ONE ekg machine in the whole facility, so if you’ve got chest pain? You have to call RAPID RESPONSE and the one RT must run to get the EKG machine from the ED To you. All EKG orders goto RT. Techs quit left and right so you’re lucky if there’s more than one for the whole unit. Charge is always in staffing and not a real charge. Your House Supervisor is pretty much your charge nurse. The House Supervisor and Nursing Director make the assignments for each shift. Staffing is wild, you may float to ED? ICU? Sit as a Telemetry Tech? Acuity is low here because the hospital capabilities are bare bones minimum. The problem is some patients get sicker and fall through the VERY LARGE CRACKS. By the time someone noticed, they may get transferred to ICU,…transferred out….or expire. Also the ICU is practically step down. Oh and ICU holds Med level pts as overflow. You have one hospitalist running the show at night. Pray you don’t need them. Goto words of night MD “it’s a day shift problem”. Also the director is shady. Management overall is shady. Watch yourself. This is where you’ll lose that hard earned license. They do whatever just go get by here. Joint Commission and the State showed up about six times during my contract. Pros: Traveler friendly for the most part. Some really hard working staff here that have no other choice but to stay. If things were not so dangerous and shady here I would come back for the people I worked with. You do have a few that are rough and have toxic personal traits that clearly need therapy. Because this is low acuity hospital,… some of these nurses just don’t know because they just don’t see much.

Central Carolina Hospital,Sanford,NC,Anonymous,4.5,4,1.5,2.5,2.5,,,,,,Emergency Room — Syndicated Review,"This was definitely not my worst travel assignment. I appreciated the community feel of this ER and that the providers were easygoing for the most part. You have at most 4-5 patients- one is strictly psych which can be good and bad depending on how you look at it. Their psych area is a small corner with 3 beds with no doors, which is not protected. This can be a liability for many reasons and yes, safety is a HUGE concern because we get busy and the PCAs are not the most attentive to psych patients' needs. The area is poorer and sadly the health literacy is not there, but a great opportunity to teach and educate. I enjoyed working with the staff for the most part. I have seen preferential treatment of their staff (they are mainly triage or float) but this is to be expected as travelers. Overall, culture is ok having had worse experiences elsewhere. I will say that management is working hard to clean the hospital from its ""bad reputation"". It is known to be unsafe, unclean and ineffective. I will say that yes, at times it can feel that way (things move slow, cerner is the worst charting system, staff gets flustered during codes) but overall, you are not alone if you need help. You may have to ask a few times but the medics and other nurses are usually helpful. Holds were thankfully not a major problem as pts got moved upstairs to med-surg or ICU quick. Transfers, though, can take time and as a community hospital, there is only so much they can do. Little annoyances- AC going out, computer being ineffective, staff nurses being lazy when you're busy- were just a few. The community of Sanford has little to do.

This hospital had no reviews so I am taking it upon myself to leave one because it was awful. This is my first contact I had to cut short. I worked medsurg on 3east it's a surgical floor but they do get a bit of everything. Techs never did there job leaving me to clean people by myself if I could (or I would ask a fellow traveler for help because they could not be found) and get my own vital signs. They have weird order stating they only want vital signs ""once a shift."" The techs take adv of this and count the 5am vitals as the one for dayshift. They give you major attitude when you ask them to get vitals at 730am before med pass. They argue with you about it so I eneded up doing it myself. I have never seen them do post surgical vitals and its a surgical floor. Other staff nurses only offer help when they feel it's needed. Then gaslight you for asking for help. The night shift pulls meds for dayshift and they expect you to do the same for nightshift. I did not feel comfortable doing this so I did not participate in that. They pull everything except controlled substances. Acuity is NOT taken into account. Assignments change all the time especially of someone is leaving at 3pm (which is a frequent occurrence) you will pick up a patient at 3pm. Another example would be if someone calls out at the last min and the charge nurse is free, instead of the charge nurse taking a group she decided to redo the assignment so everyone had 6patients and she was free to sit and do nothing. Charge nurse is free for dayshift (never on nightshift) but it depends on who it is and if they will help you or just sit there and be annoyed when you ask for help. And when I say ask for help I mean little things like paging a doctor so you can stay with your possibly crashing patient. The doctors are hit or miss. Since it's a surgical floor the surgeons are always there but if it's a hospitalist or specialist patient that return page could take from 15mins to an hour or you just won't get a response.

Basically you need to know your sh** because it’s very unlikely you’ll get any help from anyone except for fellow travelers. Honestly the patient population isn’t as bad as some make it out to be. It’s not in a very safe area, but they are grateful when they have care. There’s three sections of the ER - acute, psych, and boarders. Oh and you’ll absolutely never get a lunch break.

The patient population isn’t much better. I took my intubated patient to the ICU and came immediately back down to name calling because the room the patient was in was ”filthy.” I was called a “lazy ass” in front of a patient by a tech in triage because the room was not magically cleaned while I was up in the ICU. She did not offer to assist in getting the room ready, but instead left the next patient in a chair in the hallway outside of the room. The previous patient was intubated immediately upon arrival to the ED within the first 10 minutes so the room was messy. However, they will bring patients back before checking that you cleaned the room or offering any assistance to clean the rooms. You have to transport all of your patients when they get a bed ready upstairs which is very time consuming. The acuity for patients was extremely high and there were a lot of holds in the department. The hospitalists seemed unsure and incompetent when seeing admits. There is no staff. The entire ED was staffed by new grads and there are little to no techs. Don’t be surprised if you have an intubation and they give you two other high acuity patients at the same time while having no staff to help. High volumes of ambulances, 50 plus people in the waiting room, and no staff means you might be the only nurse in an intubation or code. Teamwork doesn’t exist. There is no transport or housekeeping at least on nights. I came to this hospital as a traveler who has experience in a hectic level one trauma emergency department.

If you are working Med/Surg you will be floating throughout several units during the duration of your contract and they will send you to the vent/trach floor even if you don’t have experience with it. As of August 2022 they are opening up a new building and planning on moving the units that are in the main building to the new one. Some days are better than others and some units are more team oriented than others. You will also need access to the Pyxis every single shift and the supervisor has to put you in to grant you access. The shift starts at 7:30am or pm and many times your relief won’t show up until 8 even though the shift starts at 7:30! I have also encountered times where I came in at 7:30 and the nurse from the prior shift left and did not give report. As an agency or travel nurse the staff will also try and give you admissions first and stay with 3/4 patients while they push a 5/6th one to you!

My first day I was told the hours were 5x8's and every other weekend on call. Everyone was pretty friendly and happy to have a traveler. The Cath Lab was in a rough spot and I hear still was 6months after I left. This is a for-profit hospital and all of the physicians have their own patients, they do not share. Multiple doctors in the same specialty would do 1-2 procedures on their scheduled day(s), which made organizing and communicating with them very difficult. A couple of the physicians were not safe at all, and the others were not responsive/collaborative with the staff. There are two labs and multiple doctors would refuse to work in one of them, causing cases to get backed up and a lot of non-emergent cases to be done after hours. We were in the process of creating a Pre/Post area, as the procedural post-op unit was overflowed. We did not have nearly enough staff to fill Pre/Post and Cath Lab. Nurses were having to arrive for their 7a-3p shift at 5:30a and RN/RTs would usually not leave before 5p, which meant most people were working 5x12's.

East Cooper Medical Center,Mount Pleasant,SC,Anonymous,3,3.5,4,5,5,,,,,,Surgical — Syndicated Review,"This hospital is severely understaffed from housekeeping, to spd, to the operating room. There are always gaps in staffing and severe needs for shifts and call to be picked up when dropped unexpectedly which was good for making money but bad for staying mentally/physically sound in the midst of all of the daily chaos. Despite a lineup of cases in a room each morning, the schedule is likely to change a handful of times so keeping up with that and keeping track of case carts is a challenge. Multiple days during my contract here the instruments for the next day were not even sterilized by the next morning. Delays are common. Surgical conscience and sterile technique is severely lacking at this hospital not only from staff but also from surgeons and assistants. Nurses have been seen contaminating objects opened to the sterile field and not understanding when, how or why they were contaminated. The PAs regularly contaminate the field by opening their gloves into instrument trays or onto instruments on Mayo stands in an unsterile manner instead of dressing off the field/opening sterile items properly (simple peel packaging). Staff routinely opens blue wrapped items without controlling corners. Aseptic technique is sloppy. Reps with laser pointers have no respect for the sterile field, pointing their fingers into trays and over instruments and implants instead of using their words, and even surgeons have been seen reaching over trays of implants to reach for a gown without waiting for the tech to dress them with a gown already at the tables edge. Radiation techs and instrument reps have been seen throwing patient labels in the garbage cans. When confronted there is denial and a complete lack of accountability. Surgeons also exhibit atrocious surgical technique and a lack of motivation to correct contaminations when they occur such as changing their gloves when punctured or not contaminating themselves to begin with, and also some have argued that they would still prefer to use a contaminated item on the sterile field rather than wait to find a new one. Instruments often have holes through the wrappers. Flash sterilization rates here are high. Housekeeping is typically only one person who is dedicated to the OR with infrequent help from housekeeping staff from other floors. Terminal cleanings are unreliable, and often in the mornings the room/equipment needs to be cleaned again due to either improper cleaning practices or things left behind like light handles or suction canisters with fluids still in them or beds not being moved during cleaning. EVS does not clean any electrical equipment, and sometimes neither does the staff. So if you don't wipe it down, it doesn't get wiped down and it becomes pretty obvious what things have not been cleaned in a while (bloody SCD machines, foot pedals, satellite equipment towers etc). Heavy, heavy, heavy Ortho spine. If you come here without spine experience you will not be able to stay out of a spine room so be open to learn in a hurry with little training or don't come here. Spine surgeons here absolutely run the staff and the charge nurses despite an inadequate amount of staff, and often start before an agency staff's contracted time. If your contract says you are a 7:30 start, you will still be expected to show up some days at 6:00 a.m. for cases that start at 7:30, with no guarantee that you will be let out at your contracted time whether that is 8, 10 or 12 hours, although some effort is made to accommodate. Staff are welcoming and tight knit. Was not difficult to feel welcomed or in with the group at 13 weeks. Cafeteria is mediocre with terrible hours so bringing lunch is recommended. Staff and travelers are only guaranteed 30 minute lunches here. There are no morning, afternoon or evening breaks, including for 12 hours shifts. You get 30 minutes and that is it, but attempts are made to meet bathroom needs if you call out for a speed break during your cases after lunch time. Housing in this area is incredibly expensive and difficult to find within 30 minutes. I never had pushback with my 38 minute drive even on call as staff residing further out is also routinely late. Traffic is absolutely the worst here and there are always accidents on the only two bridges that allow you to access this hospital, so being late if you leave late is always a risk you will take.

Scheduling is flexible and while staff you are every 3rd weekend, agency is every other weekend. We use epic and that's pretty straight forward and API for scheduling. Most doctors are nice and responsive but there are of course a few that suck. I would say the one thing I do not like about working here is that it has almost become the norm that doctors never place their own orders. I am almost always putting in orders myself unless it's a new admission, then they will put in standard admission orders. Almost every time I page the hospitalize, they page back with what to order rather than placing orders themself. This was on day shift and night shift.

Ratio did vary from 1:2-6 depending upon the week and census. There are not many PCTs staffed, especially on nights. Lots of overtime available if wanted. Again to stress this is a smaller facility, so there are not all the fancy things and equipment like everywhere else, often you won’t see as complicated patients or severe cases. There are 2 hospital doctors who rotate 7 on/ 7 off with on-call. Both are very skilled with different personalities. They manage the hospital, local nursing home, and clinic. Pharmacy is only there M-F 7-3, after 3 main Marshfield pharmacy checks the systems every so often to verify med orders and to call if there are any questions. To get medications from pharmacy, if it is not stocked in the Pxysis or the patient bin, then you can get a key out of the Pxysis to go to pharmacy and get the med needed and sign it out. Very sketchy when I first started, still sketchy to think about, but it is a smaller facility and only staff can access it, and the pharmacy is heavily secured and monitored with alarm systems and 24/7 video surveillance live and other things.

Frye Regional Medical Center,Hickory,NC,Anonymous,2.5,4.5,3,-,-,,,,,,Intensive Care — Syndicated Review,"From not getting first day instructions until 45 minutes into the first day should have been the first red flag. I cancelled my contract after 4 shifts. I wanted to cancel after the first shift but gave it a full week before putting in my notice. After putting in my notice it was clear the facility was so unsafe that I felt my license was at risk just by working their so I cancelled affective immediately. 3 different ICU’s within the facility all small ICU’s. To stretch staff they would have 3 nurses, 2 tripled in the ICU with usually no tech. The acuity of the patients being tripled was not appropriate the times it happened to me. According to travelers that have been to this facility this is a frequent occurrence. Due to there only being 3 staff on the unit and one of the ICU’s being secluded in the hospital another nurse stepped off the unit one day to go get a coffee leaving me and another nurse. Due to doing tasks in other rooms and answering call lights that nurses patient self extubated that day while he stepped off the unit. The MD had adjusted the sedation. 2 patients extubated themselves in my 5 shifts their. Thankfully never my assigned patient. I am trained on Nxt stage and was given a prismaflex CRRT on my orientation day. The patients K was over 5 and I only had 4 K fluid bags. The doc did not know how to order 2 K bags. My patients BP was critically low on multiple pressors and I was having a difficult time getting a BP and that MD refused to put in an A-line. Instead of assisting me with my Pt on multiple pressors and a UF that was 1/2 of the order to help maintain a better BP the MD did a routine bedside trach next door on a stable intubated patient. I asked for 12 hours. The night doc ended up putting one in right after the next shift came in. He openly prescribes Ivermectin to patients that have had CoVID for a week or 2 and been in the hospital and end up in the ICU for high oxygen requirements. They all end up intubated and he has a 0% success rate with this mode of therapy. The patient I had on CRRT which had not been working for this patient. This facility also has a 0% success rate with CRRT patients. With patients being inappropriately being tripled in the ICU I found an unstageable pressure sore on a patient that had been tripled multiple times in the course of a week within the ICU. The family was understandably pissed that was my first shift that week and all I could do is apologize for something I was not there for. The family also noted that they noticed the facility was short staffed. This was my tipping point because this is what happens to patients with unsafe staffing they get neglected, things get missed and mistakes happen. The facility is also utilizing travel ICU nurses to staff the rest of the hospital. I was told I would be floated rarely out of the ICU. A traveler was floated each shift in my 5 days on the unit. When floated to Med-surg they give travelers 6 patients and core staff 4. Many of the core staff at this facility were not vaccinated. This made me uncomfortable after me and my families personal battles with COVID. My main issues were the facility was unsafe with staffing and there was never a CNA to assist while tripled with 3 very sick COVID patients. And the doc at this facility made me uncomfortable with his lack of knowledge on devices he was running and his off the wall treatments with no success thus far.",https://app.scrubstr.com/hospitals/frye-regional-medical-center,"February 9, 2022"

Staffing ratios are sooooo unsafe (3:1 in COVID ICU with intubated, vec'd, proned patients). Hospital tried to pull a bait and switch by advertising ICU positions and pulling travelers to MedSurg or ER everyday. MS ratios are 1:8, ER ratios 1-5+. I never carried insurance before this assignment, but I bought it my second week here because I was terrified for my license. I refused to take 6 MS patients and was lectured about me being there to help out. Yes. In ICU. Like my contract says. ICU nurses were extremely confrontational. I had 3 patients everyday I worked and I always got the worst patients regardless of room placement because ""that's what you get paid $80 an hour for."" Most of the ICU nurses had a huge chip on their shoulder and were mad at us for even being there to help because we ""made four times the money"" they do. They refused to help us turn even with large patients so the travelers just had to stick together to do it. They mocked other travelers to their face and asked them if they were stupid for asking how to set up facility specific equipment, asking about facility specific policies (no staff nurses even knew how to look up the policies), etc. Nurses with less than 2 years of experience kept asking us with 5+ years of experience in multiple level 1 trauma centers if we knew what we were doing because they only knew the a**backward way this facility did things having never worked anywhere else. A group of new grad nurses went to the nurse manager trying to get a fellow traveler fired because they didn't think SHE knew what she was doing. It was such a hostile work environment I felt like I had to watch my back constantly. It honestly would have been a blessing to have been canceled, though. After many prayers and bottles of wine I finished out my contract and GTFO. Then they actually had the nerve to complain I wasn't extending.

Well low and behold a great paying contract for this facility came up and I decided to submit. On boarding and orientation was not so great- But I got through it and it was one of my best assignments I have taken. I started in January 2020 in the NSICU department before Covid started. Meditech really does suck, but I got used to it! The unit was very traveler friendly and I got the help I needed when I needed it. The staff nurses were friendly to me and rarely had any interpersonal issues with anyone at this facility. Fast forward to Covid.. I never once felt like I did not have the PPE I needed. They did start locking up PPE and monitoring who got what because of the shortage but I always got what I needed to do my job and feel safe. I only floated a few times towards the end of my contract due to low census. ICU travelers only float to the CVICU or the ER to take ICU holds. The staff in the other units were friendly and helpful there too. I honestly did not want to leave, but as with many of the HCA contracts, my extension was cancelled.

For one, ICU charge nurses aren’t constant. You could have a trained charge nurse one night to a charge nurse whose only been out of orientation for six months and has no other nursing experience. It didn’t matter though because the charge nurses in general would constantly try to give me patients that were not close together but both patients would be intubated and sedated on multiple drips that had to be titrated or I would have two patients in bilateral restraints 6 rooms away where I couldn’t watch both patients. The charge nurses treated their regular staff this way because they said we each watch each other patients so what does it matter. The providers would not abide by protocols even when I showed them the protocols that were in place. The provider did not know ACLS protocols nor were the charge nurses trained on what to do during the code. They would hang vasopressor medications during the code and run it wide open so then the patient would end up with a systolic blood pressure in the 300s. They would delay putting in adequate access during the code as well as try to code a patient not attached to a defibrillator to even analyze the rhythm. I even walked in on the provider and the charge nurse refusing to code a patient that was a full code and calling time of death. The patient did not have pads on nor was the patient hooked up to the defibrillator. The code cart was completely untouched. The providers also accepted neuro patients when the MRI machine was down. They even tried to give me a 1:1 patient who was on tPA even though I already had an unstable patient. To top it all off they thought it was appropriate to give me this 1:1 patient way down the hall in the corner where I couldn’t see them and the excuse they made was that the room was ready. I had to have another nurse come tell me what they were trying to do because they would not tell me to my face. I also had a provider refuse to put in an order for a KUB to confirm positive placement of an NG tube stating it was unnecessary. They chose to confirm placement with air. Providers will delay putting in central access for several days with patients on double strength pressors. They are made aware of it frequently but state that they will eventually come off it. The floor also has surgical patients and the critical team will tell you to defer to the surgical team. You’ll honestly spend your night going back and forth with issues including pain management because no one wants to address the issue. There was a three day delay because neither critical care and the surgical team wanted to put an order in for a central line but critical care put in for TPN and surgery signed off on it.

Oregon just passed staffing laws too, so their staffing ratios are only going to get better. As a traveler, you don’t float too often and even if you do, the other units are very welcoming too. Staff choose their own assignments, so you can take your patients back or say no to your “difficult patient” from the previous day.

There were shifts worked where there was a charge nurse, a couple travelers, and the staff that all had less than 9m experience. In L&D, that’s a disaster waiting to happen. Many shifts I was there with 2 laboring patients, and was preceptor to a new hire because there was no one else with enough experience to do it. While I don’t mind, I’m not sure other travelers would accept a new nurse to train on a contract? The main problem I had was that their OB docs are all working in 1980 in their minds. Every patient gets an episiotomy. EVERY ONE. One of the physicians is fecal-phobic (labor seems an odd choice but who am I to decide that), and I’ve personally seen this physician walk out of a delivery to ‘get cleaned up’ as this person was showered with amniotic fluid. SVD, CS, doesn’t matter- doc walks out. Myself and another nurse has to jump in and catch the placenta as mom was on the delivery table, legs up, with cord hanging and no doc standing there. I feel bad for the tenured RN’s who are close to retirement as they don’t have much say, and are staying put to get to retirement and get out- but they’re alone or just about alone because no staff will stay. When I was there, the unit had absolutely no management either. They’d all quit or been let go, so it was just a bunch of charge RN’s and interim managers with no women’s services experience running the show. My contract ended just on time or I’d have left anyway. It’s sad, too, because it could be a great place to have a baby.

My contract was for IMC and the IMC floor was ok, no complaints there. I would get floated constantly. In my 9 weeks I was maybe on my contracted floor for 5 shifts total. Understandable that you’ll get floated first, I’ve done plenty of float teams so no problem there. However, you’ll constantly get floated to ED holds and its hell. You constantly have 7 patients, patients not even vetted by a nurse coming straight from the lobby because they have been admitted by MDs and they’ve been waiting 15+ hours for any type of bed. You won’t get report on those patients and the majority of the time no one tells you they brought them into the room until you’ve walked past and see them in the room. I’ve gotten multiple lobby patients with critical test not completed for hours, and have came back with critical BPs/critical glucose. One that stood out was suspected stroke, patient waited 18+ hours in the lobby and no one did the MRI screening and also had bp 200s/100s. You have to do your own timed/stat labs, lab will not come for those, only schedule AM labs. I’ve come in and multiple things are missed by previous shift such has timed trops/ekgs/stat k+ levels and for some reason, nobody does their MRI screenings. Also multiple meds missed or not given by ED, or critical labs not addressed before coming over. They have NAPs to help assist and they’re your only saving grace, but they’ll have 25:1 so it’s hard finding help. I never had an issue with low supplies. However, if you want a pure wick, you have to call house sup for permission and they grant you some if they deem it acceptable because purewicks are too expensive. Had a traveler call on a 90+ yo in ED holds who had fx femur and was told they would have to call back to see if a purewick was acceptable. Been floated to ICU to take IMC runs. Nurses are super helpful when you ask but they have their hands full too, the HUCs are as well when they have time. But they don’t typically give CNAs on ICU, especially at night. So you basically have 5:1 total care. MS floor they don’t account for acuity, you just get a run. Ended up getting all the Covid patients and 2/3 of the tele sitters on the floor that night just because that was the run. They will not split it up. Only MD I ever saw was admitting MD in ED holds, they would not approach you at all. And good luck getting ahold of anyone from general surgery. You can page multiple times and no one will call back. Management is non-existent. Went through 2 managers in the span of 9 weeks that I was there.

It is impossible to get them to come to the bedside, let alone get orders. When you actually get an order you are expected to put it in. Travelers will always float. Even being floated to MS is difficult as each MS unit has their own rules and way of doing things that you are expected to know. Being floated to ED holds is an absolute hellscape.

There's no urgency about anything, no critical drips are kept in the pyxis so when you're in an emergent event your going back in forth with the pharmacy.

They abuse their power with the nurses and to the patients and regular staff are accepting and never raise issues with the doctors or management. I had several issues with doctors due to safety concerns and I was yelled and disrespected like never before and the other nurses were unphased. 2) the other nurses are nice but due to high turnover in staffing, they lack critical thinking skills and essential teamwork/communication skills that is necessary on a L&D floor. 3) the floors layout does not accommodate for the amount of deliveries they do monthly. Many times we lacked supplies such as tocos or ultrasounds to monitor patients that were admitted. We would be over flowing with moms (all labor rooms full, triage full, and 10+ moms waiting to be assessed in triage) and doctors would send over patients for elective inductions. the doctors very much work against the nurses. The charting system is also paragon. It is so outdated and too much clicking-takes too long to put in orders especially during emergencies 4) most nights the staff was more travelers than core staff and they lacked proper staffing in general. When a patient is complete and getting ready to push the ratio is 1:1 but there was many situations where no one else would be available to watch my other laboring patient while I pushed. They also will have other nurses break you but they do a terrible job at watching your patients. There was so many times where I came back and my fetal heart tones were off for the full break. I received a patient at change of shift that was in triage for 4+ hours and was only sent over for a NST and the day shift nurse hadn’t even applied the ultrasound to monitor heart tones for 4 hours.

Sofia is a charge nurse that does the schedule. Be careful asking her questions. She will answer even if she does not know. I asked about the laws in MD regarding a mom with a positive UDS. She said there's nothing special or different that has to be done. In fact, social services must be notified and they notify CPS. When I confronted her, she said she had never said this. There were a few other things as well. Both of these nurses are day shift and I was night shift. I would have quit had I had to endure them for 12 hours.

Shady. Their scheduling is done on Nursegrid and is a nightmare because they only put it out about a week before the new schedule starts. Whoever is doing the schedule now also has no idea to work Nursegrid so the daily schedule is never accurate. If you have time off in your contract, you better remind them because every single time I was scheduled during my contracted time off. Also, they went through a provider overhaul. They changed staffing contracts with the providers. The new providers that came in were condescending and rude. The ones that stayed are bitter and treat the staff like trash. This is the most incompetent group of management and providers I have ever worked with. They still have not worked out their growing pains even though this switch happened 5 months ago.

Again, the staff nurses were great and I would love to work with a staff like them again. Sadly, management ruined this hospital for me.

There is a staff shortage. Patient ratios can range from 1 to 6 or (8 night shift). Some days there aren't enough PCT to help so you have to provide total patient care. The doctors aren't really attentive so you have to be their eyes and voice 99% of the time. You are expected to do line changes, 95% of the time wound care, transport patients, case manage, and be the lab technician. Also, the insulin coverage orders are complex compared to just covering simply sliding scale. The operating machines and telephone lines are outdated.

Jackson - Madison County General Hospital,Jackson,TN,Anonymous,4,5,3.5,5,3.5,,,,,,Telemetry/Step-down — Syndicated Review,"This was my first contract, and overall it was a decent experience. I was on Ortho/tele floor nights, and it was fairly laid back and ratios never exceeded 5:1, more often than not were 4:1. If there wasn’t a PCT scheduled they would float an extra nurse to the unit, so sometimes had 3:1 ratio. Charge RN takes full assignment on this floor, but most of them will go out of their way to help you, especially in a crisis. Charting was a pain, they were very particular about what they wanted charted and the hospital disabled the copy and paste feature so it felt like I spent more time charting than doing patient care. Agency nurses were first to float, but they did well taking turns floating us. I floated about once a week on average, and never mid-shift. I was never called off for a scheduled shift, and there were plenty of overtime opportunities. They let you self schedule, and the unit supervisor was very easy to work with if changes needed to be made. My biggest complaints were that the providers were only available via a messenger app at night and often would take 30-60 minutes to read/respond to messages, and my contract being cut after my 1st week by $400/week with less than a weeks notice. If I hadn’t spent weeks trying to secure my first contract, I would’ve declined the rate decrease and went home. The city of Jackson itself isn’t the safest, and there isn’t a ton to do in the immediate area. I found myself having to drive hour(s) away to find adequate outdoor activities. Housing is slim pickings, but I managed to find a cheap extended stay in a crummy part of town.

But be aware, Stroger pays ZERO for any overtime. That is dependent on your agency and I’ve heard some (Aya) don’t pay any OT, so when it’s time to leave, leave. Don’t let anyone make you feel bad about not finishing charting or whatever it is. Also, when you take a lunch, make note of who you give report to. I had a charge RN relieve me & whom I gave report to & she told the supervisor I left without giving report. The supervisor tried to then berate me.

The RN manager went to great lengths to help find me a place to live which was the only reason I was able to find housing. Finding a place to park a camper is difficult. The town of Livingston is walkable, cycleable and quaint. There isn't much to do but the river runs through and Bozeman is only 30 minutes away for slightly more entertainment.

The ICU started as partial covid-unit and partial clean unit and by the end of the contract the entire MICU floor was covid-19. N95s were chemically cleaned between shifts and new were given after 5 uses. The facility is older and it shows sometimes. The IV pumps need replacing as more and more had battery issues. There weren't enough CNAs to keep up with the challenges on the unit and we were encouraged to ask other RNs for help, which was challenging when everyone had their own teams to attend to. The Charge RNs were outstanding and did what they could to assist and facilitate problem solving. Sadly, there were simply too many patients coming to keep us from getting overwhelmed. The hospital reminded me of the one I used to call home; older building, understaffed, overworked, with the RNs and support staff doing what they could, but not having all the tools needed to get the job done. I did learn and felt supported in a very tough time. The equipment isn't perfect (Neuro ICU monitors wouldn't upload vitals into EPIC so had to be done manually).

Lovelace Womens Hospital,Albuquerque,NM,Anonymous,3.5,3,4.5,4,4,,,,,,Intensive Care — Syndicated Review,"The ICU here is small: 8 beds, maybe saw 2 ventilator patients per year before COVID. They aren't experienced with pressors or titratable drips. Pharmacy rolls over for anything the MD requests. They have a very high attrition rate among permanent staff, to the point some shifts will be ALL travelers and a traveler will be expected to take Charge RN duties. Some doctors are verbally abusive and attempt to publicly humiliate RNs, or tell an RN ""that's impossible, they would be dying"" if an RN brings up a serious concern and refuse to assess the patient. Med-Surg floors are drowning, as is the ER. ICU will be asked to float to ER or to the floor, but usually only take an isolation patient on 1:1 suicide precautions if on the floor. Plastic Surgery does DIEP flap breast reconstructions, and they are very particular about their patients (but very approachable and kind to RNs, understanding travelers can't know what they weren't told). No tube station, you walk all your own labs and pick up all your own meds. No techs. Staff (where they exist) can be very traveler friendly and welcoming. It's a really great area of Albuquerque. You're lucky if you have NP coverage on nights. An intensivist tends to run ICU patients, but there is a hospitalist assigned to every patient (though they seem really defeated and just trying to get through the day).

Mainegeneral Medical Center,Augusta,ME,Anonymous,3.5,4,3,2,4.5,,,,,,Intensive Care — Syndicated Review,"Charting is SCM, a very dinosaur charting system that is block based. It is a WiFi based system so it crashes easily. Providers and nurses alike were all concerned with this charting system and hoping for a change. Unfortunately, the hospital does not see that expensive change in its future. Assignments: In the CCU, it can be fairly mixed patient population. From med surg to intermediate/PCU to ICU patients. The problem? They don’t actually have a PCU status for a patient: it’s ICU level of care of Floor level of care. So ICU level of care patients are frequently tripled with floor level care patients. Frequently. This solely has to do with the facilities refusal to establish a 2:1 ICU ratio. You can have patients with actively titrating pressors , a fib RVR, and a vent all within the same assignment. Refusing admissions is not a thing. The charge nurses have no say on that, even if staff isn’t available. And charge nurses don’t take assignments. They will triple an ICU assignment and the charge will still be without patients. I worked hard at this hospital and the people/coworkers are great! Phenomenal physicians. Management is okay, manager is much more caring and understanding than assistant manager (who has very little experience). But the assignment frustration and being told I don’t have a choice when I don’t feel it’s safe is so frustrating.

Massachusetts General Hospital,Boston,MA,Anonymous,4,3,3.5,5,5,,,,,,Intensive Care — Syndicated Review,"I was told I’d be in the MICU but I ended up in their overflow ICU (Blake 12). Positives: Low acuity patients, approachable and knowledgeable physicians, and excellent ratios. They frequently staff 1:1 even if the patient isn’t 1:1 acuity. My only negative was my experience with the staff on my specific unit. Orientation is 4 days of being nitpicked into the ground and treated like a new grad. Staff are cliquey and unfriendly. If a non-crisis alarm rang more than twice (like think 2 dings) the charge nurse would be hunting you down asking why your alarms are going off. The atmosphere felt very judgmental and micromanage-y. My first day preceptor openly expressed the staff’s dislike for travelers to my face *on my first day*, and in general I overheard a lot of open negativity about travelers. I even had a charge nurse announce in the middle of the nurses station that new education was being implemented because “the travelers are ruining everything”…in front of a group of travelers. I felt uncomfortable and unwelcome, which is a shame because it was a super easy assignment otherwise. The irony is that their patients are not high acuity whatsoever and yet their staff have such an attitude of superiority.

Mayo has teams for literally everything: IV Teams (there aren't even supplies to change a dressing on this floor), urology team (both male and female teams - handle all bladder scans, straight caths, and Foley's), blood teams (will start and do initial monitoring on all blood products), etc. Providers are very resistant to transfer to higher level of care even when floor policy criteria has been met, instead will ask nurses to give IV medications that most definitely would require cardiac monitoring.

Mease Dunedin Hospital,Dunedin,FL,Anonymous,3,5,4,2,4,,,,,,Intensive Care — Syndicated Review,"Ok so the Baycare hospitals in Tampa (there’s 15) have internal seasonal contract available every winter. 13 week contracts that you can do one extension on if the need is there and it gives you a foot in the door to do that every year. You can request to float between hospitals for a higher hourly wage or do a slightly lower hourly wage and be in one hospital (that’s what I chose) but they select the hospital for you. There’s also an option for a higher hourly wage or a lower wage but a housing stipend (1500/ month). I also chose the stipend. So those are the perks, the stipend and $83/hour is my current wage. The downside is the unit I am on I was told by HR is an ICU. It is not. It’s 20 beds, and they basically run it as an overflow med tele floor. It’s a super small hospital and they ship everything to the sister hospital (Morton plant) 15 min up the road. So more often than not you have 3-4 patients and good luck getting a ventilator. So if you’re ok with not having sick patient or using your critical care brain much for high pay near the gulf then this is the job for you.

I did a lot of classroom orientation but also spent hours sitting around with nothing to do and no instruction. Granted, they were paying me to sit around and do nothing, but it was frustrating. This position was also marketed to me as Med-Surg but is more a combination of low acuity Med-Surg and high acuity rehab. I worked on the Spinal Cord Injury and Ortho unit. I did a contract on nights first where something called the bowel program is the responsibility of night shift. The bowel program requires digital stimulation of the rectum, digital evacuation of any stool, and then the insertion of a suppository (sometimes an enema). This is scheduled at 8 pm, right after report. Meds are scheduled at 10 pm. You’re *supposed to* check back 15-30 minutes later to see if they had a bowel movement and if not, you’re supposed to do digital stimulation again. The most bowel programs I had at once was 4, with up to 7 patients. As you can imagine, there was not time to actually do the second check and second dig stim, as you have to do your assessments, pass medications, and deal with any patient requests and needs that come up. It is a very heavy unit when it comes to ADLs as many of the patients are quadriplegic or post-BKA. The majority of patients need to at least be supervised for toileting, but many require help with transferring or are bedbound. Night shift is bad at the beginning of shift, however, day shift can be bad/hectic throughout the entire shift some days. Many of the nurses can be standoffish, especially before they get used to you, and some are downright rude. Once they got used to me, I was able to go to some nurses for help, but expect to be on your own often. Management was not helpful. During day shift, there is a meeting scheduled that you must attend called “team conference” where you meet with the doctor, PT, OT, social work, etc. for any of your patients that are scheduled for their once a week team conference that day. This meeting can be stressful as you must schedule your care around it and if a patient happens to call while you’re at the meeting, better hope your tech is free. 2/3 doctors that I had to deal with were rude or standoffish. The spinal cord doctor is nice once you get to know her. There are some techs that are unable to/unwilling to actually do their job so depending on which tech is assigned to your patients, you may end up doing all care for some patients.

This was, however, expressed to me during my interview so I thankfully wasn’t totally blind sided…however I was surprised at what patients they consider to be icu vs. stepdown vs. MST. Icu patients here are truly stepdown patients and stepdown patients are truly Ms/MST patients. This made for relatively easy days and this assignment was the least stressful job I have ever had. Again they do t take truly critical patients and rarely have patients who are actually admitted as ICU status so with that being said most days my assignment was a mixture of stepdown and med-surg patients. That got to be annoying after a while because I would spend every shift discharging and admitting patients and I craved the flow of ICU. If you’re looking for an easy assignment and slower change of pace then this is the place for you.

Marysville is a small town so there isn’t too too much to do but Columbus is only 30 minutes away.

Staff are trained in unsafe practices and are also so burnt out they don’t care. Prone to talking shit about you behind your back. One traveler has been traveling for 10 years and said it was the worst assignment she’d ever been to. ER is about 80 beds and didn’t have near enough staff for the rooms they had so you would occasionally get 5-6 pts. Didn’t have proper equipment for intimated pts so they became 1:1 pts because all you would have were pushes of meds to keep your pts sedated. ER docs could be rude to travelers and blame the fact that you were a traveler on their mistakes.,https://app.scrubstr.com/hospitals/mercy-hospital-springfield,"November 6, 2021"

Mercy Hospital Springfield,Springfield,MO,Anonymous,2,2,3,1,2,,,,,,Med-Surg — Syndicated Review,"I first started this contract in November 2021, I started for an amazing rate for 48 hours on medical oncology. 1 Charge nurse on night shift was an absolute jerk to all, not helpful rude, made the work environment very uncomfortable. Floated often to Cardiac floor, fell in love with the nurses down there so when I was being floated I just called staffing and asked to float there since 80% of the hospital or more was made up of travelers. After 4 or 5 weeks of my 13 contract the hospital got rid of safe patient rations meaning some floors who were less staffed such as Med surg were required to take upwards of 10-12 patients on night shift. My average was 7-8 only no aid or 1 so most of the time patients were total care. TOTAL CARE WITH 8 + patients. On top of safe patient ratios they did not group based on acuity just room numbers so you could easily get stuck with 4+ confused bed jumpers. Charge nurses took whole patient assignments often night time managers were staffing as well. After 20 weeks we got the notice they were lowering our rates or firing us all they dropped there rates from $3800-$4500 down to $1800 and expected all the travelers to stay. Luckily my contract was over before most of the travelers left but friends said staffing got much worse. On average 1 - 2 staff nurses per floor per shift, sometimes the floor was nothing but travelers with NO CHARGE NURSE. Nurses weren't trained on how to call rapids, doctors were rude as hell often belittled the travelers refused to answer calls and did not prescribe medications.",https://app.scrubstr.com/hospitals/mercy-hospital-springfield,"May 31, 2023"

Most of the time there was no charge nurse on nights and when there was, they have full patient load. Often 1 aide for 28-30 patients on a floor while you have 7-8 patients yourself. You float all the time. A lot of patients not appropriate for the floor and don’t get moved until you call a rapid or code. Mostly travelers on nights lot of times it’s blind leading the blind.

The cafeteria is open at night but you’ll spend your stipend on meals alone. Horribly overpriced garbage. The hospital has a policy to get people in beds asap so it doesn’t matter if you’re 8:1 you’ll now be 9:1. Every floor I worked- I hardly ever met any core staff- that hospital is run by travelers and maybe 3 PCAs. They don’t pay their core staff a decent wage. Probably why most have quit to go travel.

I heard that in particular it’s not very well supported on the L and D unit 😞. The unit is half travel RNs and both the travelers and staff were helpful. There are no protocols?? It’s all “MD order driven” which is less helpful when you are trying to figure out how often you need to chart what. Some days were ok but on the whole I was over worked there. Ended up staying for about 5 months. Was offered a break maybe twice? It’s just the kind of place where you get your food in when you can. The docs were fine- it’s a relatively big unit so there are a ton of providers. A few annoying apples but on the whole east to work with.

Montefiore Med Center - Jack D Weiler Hosp Of A Einstein College Div,Bronx,NY,Anonymous,4,4,4,2,3,,,,,,Intensive Care — Syndicated Review,"ICU staff RN’s float to tele and receive up to 6 Pt’s. Tele nurses are also expected to float to ICU. The tele/medsurg floors are dangerous with daily rapids/codes. It isn’t possible to make sure all these patients are safe, or to know your patients at all, especially when you’re covering another nurse to make 12 Pts (no break nurses). Safety watches are often not provided after 11 pm due to short staffing, so nurses have to be their own safety watch. ADN’s do not support staff when serious concerns of safety are voiced and instead divert attention to trivial issues . Nursing turnover is very high and the hospital cannot hold staff. 150-200 travelers are working at any point to fill this gap. This includes management and upper admin. A pension is offered and free healthcare for life after so many yrs of work, but practice is very unsafe and stressful. There is no team rounding in the ICU’s so it’s hard to tell what’s going on. Dr’s/surgeons often become irritated when asked what the plan for a patient is. There is very little teamwork between disciplines, with few exceptions. Policies are difficult to find or nonexistent, which makes it - challenge to protect your license. ICU’s are not cross-trained, making it difficult to flex staff for needs of equipment (IABP,CRRT,Impalla, Arctic sun etc) and not all staff are trained on each unit. If you are not comfortable with an assignment (depending on the unit) there’s a good chance you’ll be bullied or shamed into it. This is especially true for floating out of your scope. The ICU nurses are excellent and truest do the best they can to provide safe care. Each unit works to make assignments fair despite staffing limitations. How much management will support you varies. Patients’ course of care are often “complicated” by nicked arteries and other errors. There is little compassion or empathy from the surgical teams who typically round in the morning without notice and inflict horrible pain on their patients. This hospital is only worth it if you’re a traveler. 7N, now the CCU, is known as the exception to Montefiore’s reputation.

Nebraska Medical Center,Omaha,NE,Anonymous,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,,,,,,Telemetry/Step-down — Syndicated Review,"There's only one store in Omaha that sells the specially embroidered (expensive) scrubs. On-boarding edu was standard but they don't tell you about what is required and audited until you're in trouble for not being 100% compliance. There's no grace period for being a minute or two late which also isn't explained until after they report you to your recruiter. HVU is technically a med/surg floor but you'll get 1 day post cabg with pacer wires amd and cardiac drips. There's also heart transplant patients and LVADs that aren't assigned to travel nurses. Still considered med/surg though so they can keep ratios at 5:1. No problem staying busy here. Staff are really nice and helpful. Aides do a lot and work hard. There's no strong leadership though because the manager is out with personal issues and the temps rotate. Even when the manager was here, I didn't even meet her or know of her presence until over a month into my contract. I only floated once for 4 hours on day shift but night shift travelers float the majority of the time. For some reason Nebraska Medicine doesn't believe in peri wipes so all cleaning is done with washcloths. Parking is atrocious. The parking lot is quite a distance and if your truck doesn't fit (like mine) then prepare yourself for a ten block hike. Somewhere in the hospital complex (there's several buildings) there's a Starbucks, subway, and convenience store but there's rarely enough time for breaks on this unit. It really isn't the worst contract I've done but there's massive room for improvement. Patients come in with stroke symptoms and don't get CT scan for 3 days. I've seen patient wait over 36 hours for MRI that was ordered at admission. The staff nurses are burnt out and underpaid. Most are young and still afraid to look for something new and better.

Mid contract the hospital got tired of issues with wipes clogging the toilets, so they took all wipes away entirely. Staff were to use wash clothes and then those ran out at times. Staff would corner you and try to guilt you into picking up shifts (which were paid at 40$ an hour…nope) Working nights they would give you a full patient assignment and expect you to discharge patients at 10 pm, then flood you with ED admits. Day shift charge flat out said they give worst assignments to travelers. Doctors do not care to return phone calls, even when patients decline. Night hospitalist yelled on the phone several times with me and called me stupid and cursed at me.

ER pharmacist on the unit 24/7, RT is pretty absent but hey i can bag someone all day if needed lol Doctors are overall nice and receptive.

Ochsner Medical Center,New Orleans,LA,Anonymous,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,,,,,,Telemetry/Step-down — Syndicated Review,"Review is for Neuro Progressive Care (NPU). Most of these patients are total care and/or have behavioral issues. Staffing calls for 4 techs for 40 patients but rarely do they have 4, usually 2 or more often than not one gets pulled to be a sitter. Four weeks into my contract I’ve had 5 patients once, most of the time it’s 1:4, but it happens every now and then. Most of the time nurses are getting their own vitals and blood sugars, refilling pt. water pitchers, and sometimes changing their incontinent patients alone due to who is working. Due to the high acuity of these patients and back breaking work you put into taking care of them the teamwork on the unit is lacking. For instance, 90% of the time nurses will only answer call lights if it’s their own patient and no one else’s. The unit consists of about 80% travelers. There is always a free charge nurse, they call them OC’s here…sometimes 2 if you’re lucky. They do help out a lot when you have questions or problems. It’s common for nurses/techs to be late coming into work but their are no real consequences because they are desperate to keep all staff. It is a large 850 bed teaching/magnet hospital, which has its perks but also makes it very challenging to know who to call/page/secure chat to get in touch with one of the patients doctors.

Owensboro Health Regional Hospital,Owensboro,KY,Anonymous,4,4,3,3,2,,,,,,Telemetry/Step-down — Syndicated Review,"As a seasoned travel nurse, I approach each assignment with optimism and an eagerness to contribute my skills and knowledge. However, my recent experience at a facility, which I had expected to be a pulmonary stepdown unit, turned out to be markedly different from what was initially presented. This review aims to provide an honest and detailed account for fellow travel nurses considering future assignments. **Expectation vs. Reality:** The contract portrayed the assignment as a pulmonary stepdown unit with a manageable patient-nurse ratio of 1:4, scaling up to 1:6 for lower acuity cases. In reality, the standard ratio was consistently 1:6, encompassing a tele/med-surg patient population. This discrepancy significantly impacted the workload and the nature of the care required. **Physician Interaction:** A critical aspect of any nursing role is the relationship and communication with physicians. Unfortunately, the nocturnists at this facility were notably unresponsive and non-communicative, making it challenging to secure timely orders and ensure optimal patient care. **Facility Conditions:** On a positive note, the hospital's cleanliness was commendable. However, this was overshadowed by a severe shortage of essential supplies. This lack of resources not only added stress to the nursing tasks but also raised concerns about the ability to deliver quality patient care. **Staffing and Support:** The staffing situation was alarming. The facility consistently operated with inadequate staffing, often lacking essential safety sitters or CNAs/techs. This shortfall placed an additional burden on the nursing staff, impacting both the quality of patient care and the work environment. **Team Dynamics:** A silver lining in this experience was the nursing staff, who were genuinely nice and supportive. Their camaraderie in challenging circumstances was a testament to their professionalism and dedication. **Overall Impression:** Despite the positive aspects, the stark contrast between the contract's portrayal and the actual conditions, combined with poor physician interactions and systemic issues, compels me to advise caution. For fellow travel nurses seeking assignments that align with their professional expectations and provide a supportive work environment, this facility may not be the ideal choice. **Rating:** Considering all factors, I rate this travel nursing assignment 2.5 out of 5. The experience was a stark reminder of the importance of thoroughly vetting potential assignments and being prepared for discrepancies between what is promised and the reality on the ground.",https://app.scrubstr.com/hospitals/owensboro-health-regional-hospital,"November 29, 2023"

Was told during my interview that travelers usually got NIPPV and below, which is fine. Got there only to have to sit through an Epic class without a test out option, had to read 98 policies, and had to be signed off on an entire new grad orientation binder. They wanted me to orient on days only to work nights, but I asked if I could orient nights instead, but then I didn’t receive my binder for sign offs until I was already on my own and was told I “technically” wasn’t supposed to do anything independent without being signed off, so I had to track down my preceptors to sign off. I also had to get signed off on types of patients they told me I wouldn’t ever get. Ended up only getting 1:3 feeder growers nearly the entire assignment instead of 1:2 of respiratory kids as told in the interview. Floated once to peds and was forced to take an admission (policy is NICU doesn’t take admissions on peds — I wasn’t even allowed to take admissions on NICU) and then at 0300 I was floated to PICU, only for someone who came in at 0300 to the peds floor and took my old kids to then come to PICU at 0815 to relieve me of my PICU patients.

Pikeville Medical Center,Pikeville,KY,Anonymous,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,,,,,,Intensive Care — Syndicated Review,"I work staff here, but can tell you what I have seen from the travelers viewpoint. You will get 1 to 2 days of orientation on the floor, then you will be out on your own. How helpful the staff is, is dependent on which rotation you are working with. On one rotation the other nurses are helpful and the aides are very good. If you are with the other then you will not get much help and the aides are terrible. Most of the doctors are good to work with, the ones we have left anyways. Many have left over the past few months. This is speaking from a night shift perspective. You will have to work 4x12s the do not offer anything else and will not budge from this. The majority of the nurses have less than 3 years experience, many of the older ones have left recently. Being a traveler here, you will float to other floors and normally you will be first to get a admit if you have an open bed. Travelers do not seem to get floated too much here, but it does happen on occasion. A big plus here is you will never get tripled, I have never seen anyone here tripled, staff or traveler. Other than getting first admit and the occasional float to medsurg, travelers get treated like everyone else. It is not a terrible place to work, but there is a lot that could be improved upon. Supplies are readily available most of the time, the important stuff anyway, sometimes have to run to another floor but not all the time. There are 3 ICU units here, which you could work on anyone of them. MICU, SICU, and an overflow floor that isnt always open. Even if you float to SICU, you will not get a fresh heart or CRRT as a traveler. They are a little heavy on the charting requirements here. Scrub color is Royal Blue.

Poplar Bluff Regional Medical Center,Poplar Bluff,MO,Anonymous,4,4.5,3.5,2,3,,,,,,Telemetry/Step-down — Syndicated Review,"I enjoyed working here. The people were very nice. Two things that could have been better: 1. Overly strict two nurse scanning rules for routine subcu heparin and insulin. This made it difficult to do our job because you either had to prescan everything in the med room where other nurses are handy during med collection, which I didn’t feel safe doing (I scan at bedside), or leave your patient in middle of a med pass and go find another nurse to scan with you, which meant roaming the halls waiting for someone, and made it impossible to complete your med pass on time or to spend much time with your patients. I saw one serious med mistake happen because of prescanning at this facility. It is intended to improve safety but actually creates a safety issue. 2. You have to scan patients armband every 2 hours (nurse and tech swap even and odd hours) for safety rounds. If they aren’t physically scanned, your safety round doesn’t count and is a mark against you. It’s unreasonable to scan sleeping patients every 2 hours at night and often wakes them up and frustrates them.",https://app.scrubstr.com/hospitals/poplar-bluff-regional-medical-center,"January 19, 2021"

ICU was 8 bed (really 7) and housed PCU status patients, with the rare exception of an intubated patient. Mostly, it was PCU status ETOH and Heroin detox with related liver and pancreas involvement. Higher acuity were shipped out. No intensivists physically present at facility, they were all available via video conference. Hospitalists were writing ICU orders. Schedule was difficult to get and typically given last minute. Picking up extra shifts in advance was very difficult and I did get some phone calls about picking up shifts that night (calls while I slept). The city this facility is housed in is the heroin capital of New Mexico (population 10,000). I stayed about 15 miles away in a casino hotel. I wouldn't feel safe in Espanola. The staff were generally helpful and friendly and sometimes I felt that the house sup. didn't have my back. I didn't see 1 art. line or much in the way of ICU status patients.

When this happens, I would get a call from them early in the morning telling me what hospital I had been floated to that day, some being over an hour away. Other than this, I loved my time here and would absolutely consider coming back!",https://app.scrubstr.com/hospitals/providence-portland-medical-center,"October 26, 2023"
Providence Regional Medical Center - Colby,Everett,WA,Anonymous,1.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"Let me start by saying I am a dialysis nurse so the company is Pugnent Sound Kidney Centers. It is seperate from the hospital. I arrived the Saturday before my contract was to begin. I arrived Monday morning as first day instructions asked at 430. I figured they would have me with a tech.( No problem) When I get to the facility, it is an outpatient clinic. Outpatient runs totally different from Acutes.( I have worked both) Okay. No worries, lets make the best of it! The first thing the educator tells me on introduction is ""I don't know nothing about acutes, I dont know why they sent you here with me"" 😳😳😳 Really again I am 100% glass half full! I respond well lets make the best of it! I sat for 12 hours and only set up 1 machine, tested a D 6 meter and set up my email. This lady had no clue! Any question I had pertaining to the unit, she could not answer. She referred me to my manager on arrival to acute unit.. Okay, so that was Monday. Tuesday off Wednesday off Thursday, I report to the hospital at 0730 for my assigned 0800 shift. Its a huge facility. On arrival to the unit, they are clearly overwelhmed, under staffed and the nurses whom are present are under qualified.( scary) The nurse whom I am assigned to work with is not present just yet. By 0900 my assigned nurse still is not present, the CN calls her and wakes her up. She arrives at 11 am for her shift. I begin what we will call orientation. I watched as she took a PD, set up a machine and provided very, very detailed information on dialysis. ( I am a 6 year experienced dialysis nurse)😂 Middle of the day arrives and we get 4 add ons in addition to the already assigned patients. My trainer tells me I'm gonna have to do a patient. No worries, glass half full. ( we left at 1 am this night) That Friday we arrived early for a busy schedule of patients. ( 0600) on arrival I have 2 assigned patients, a PD to take off and put on and be a runner in between. Mind you, I don't have puss access, epic access, a badge to let me into units nor do I know where to go! I politely remind the trainer of all this, she tells me, we have to worry about that later, patients first! ( how🤷🤷) no worries, glass half full. I find my way to the other side of the building( the towers as they call them) by asking staff and reading signs. The hospital staff is very friendly on the units. We make it through the day and work the following Saturday. That Saturday I have 2 patients assigned, cool. I arrive at 8 and start early. Halfway through my first bedaide, I receive a text from the CN. We have a SLED that needs to be set up. She informs me I meed to set this up after my patient is done. Okay cool, hlass half full! I finish my patient, chart, disinfect etc. Inget to tue storage room to get a machine, the machine clearly has not been wiped down and the last disinfection was the 10. The day was May 15. So to put this patient on I must disinfect first😳😤😤 Cool, glass half full. Disinfection done. I get tonthe room set up and the machine won't pass testing and when it finally does it starts to give all sorts of crazy alarms. So I call the CN and tell her she or someone else needs to set up. By now its 8pm and I meed to start my next treatment. She gets angry and says there is no one else. Okay. I turn machine off to revoit it, rinse again and then start patient. Fine👿👿 I get to my second patient at 2130. He starts at 2200 and TX ends at 0240. I get home at 0400 after all that. The rest of the staff is gone. Glass is still half full! ( 18 hour days everyday) Breaks are a limited. As is communication from dialysis management to the staff. I have 62 hours on my orientation week This is what gets me. On Monday the manager sends a text stating she is coming over to the unit to help me get set up. She never Arrives. Soon after I get a text from her saying to call her to discuss why I have so many hours, I lost it! I sent a detailed text and copied my recruiter and HR person from my agency. At the end of the detailed and I mean detailed text I informed them all that moving forward I would do 36 hours ONLY! That Tuesday management was there personally getting my badge done, pysis access and epic access completed. I wasn't even in the system. Shady as all get out. Only reason they are trying to kiss ass is because I know all modalities and they need me to stay. They had the expectation to get me to extend. Offered more money, nope, I think not! I know travelers get the tail end of the stick but this is beyond that. They go out of the way to try and not work but want to dump it all on you. CN are inexperienced and depend on the travel staff to pick up the slack. Grateful I only signed for 8 weeks😜😜😜 Dialysis beware!

On-boarding edu was standard but they don't tell you about what is required and audited until you're in trouble for not being 100% compliance. There's no grace period for being a minute or two late which also isn't explained until after they report you to your recruiter. HVU is technically a med/surg floor but you'll get 1 day post cabg with pacer wires amd and cardiac drips. There's also heart transplant patients and LVADs that aren't assigned to travel nurses. Still considered med/surg though so they can keep ratios at 5:1. No problem staying busy here. Staff are really nice and helpful. Aides do a lot and work hard. There's no strong leadership though because the manager is out with personal issues and the temps rotate. Even when the manager was here, I didn't even meet her or know of her presence until over a month into my contract. I only floated once for 4 hours on day shift but night shift travelers float the majority of the time. For some reason Nebraska Medicine doesn't believe in peri wipes so all cleaning is done with washcloths. Parking is atrocious. The parking lot is quite a distance and if your truck doesn't fit (like mine) then prepare yourself for a ten block hike. Somewhere in the hospital complex (there's several buildings) there's a Starbucks, subway, and convenience store but there's rarely enough time for breaks on this unit. It really isn't the worst contract I've done but there's massive room for improvement. Patients come in with stroke symptoms and don't get CT scan for 3 days. I've seen patient wait over 36 hours for MRI that was ordered at admission. The staff nurses are burnt out and underpaid. Most are young and still afraid to look for something new and better.

They help do your baby baths, labs, PKUs, car seat studies etc. Patient ratio was 1:8 the majority of the time. Never floated while I was there. We are required to get the consents signed (circumcision) which is new and weird for me. I’m used to the doctors going into the room and explaining the procedure to the parents, answering questions, explaining risk and benefits and then once that’s been done they sign the concent and we then get mom to sign. Here, they have a “master copy” of the consent and the important information they need to know about. We give that to them, explain it and then they sign. Over all it was an enjoyable assignment, considering I stayed for 7 months!",Scrubster,"November 19, 2022"

Doctors don’t talk to other Doctors- i.e. hospitalist doesn’t talk to gastro - they ask the nurses to relay messages to the other speciality and nurses are responsible for calling in all consults. Nurses are expected to get all informed consents - surgeries, procedures etc. We don’t do surgeries, surgeons need to get their own consents. Orders for MRIs, CT scans - nurses have to call the depts to make sure that their pt can be slotted to get their scan done - if nurses don’t call, the pt can literally wait days to get their scan completed. The doctors DRAG their feet with pt care. Definitely slow, terrible communication, and a ton of extra burden put on already overtaxed nurses. Majority of staff is either agency or travel. If you are contracted for ICU know that you will not work ICU - usually PCU 4-5 pts",Scrubster,"August 20, 2022"

They are severely short staffed, which is common anywhere hiring travelers. Ratios are appropriate the majority of the time. Cafeteria is just okay. Coffee shop in the hospital not great, stop before work if you like good coffee. Staff nurses are friendly and willing to show you where things are. Everyone works every other weekend. You can swap shifts with staff or other travelers. Got a full 3 days of orientation. Management is decent but less visible than other places I’ve worked. My badge worked for everything the first day. Communication is poor (when getting EMSs or a new patient) but not a deal breaker. I was told the day I picked up my badge by management that lunch breaks are basically non-existent but they are not sticklers about eating at the desk etc. so it isn’t terrible or a deal breaker. Large ER with 4 different main sides/care areas. They change assignments generally every 4 hours. Hit or miss on ancillary staff. EKG techs and phlebotomy some days but the monitors in the room do 12 leads which is so nice. ER pharmacist on the unit 24/7, RT is pretty absent but hey i can bag someone all day if needed lol Doctors are overall nice and receptive. Transport services are used for any ICU or IMC/PCU pts so you don’t have to know how to get to other units. Teamwork is absolutely non-existent in this ED. Pyxis is the medication dispenser, EPIC charting, they have iPhones that connect to epic so you can chart/scan meds/collect labs/message doctors. Any combo of navy and white is scrub color for RNs. ER dayshift is 0645-1915 (earliest clock in 0638 last way clock in 0652), no huddle so everyone sits in the break room until 7am then everyone migrates to the charge desk to find out assignments which is strange to me but also not terrible.

Ochsner Medical Center,New Orleans,LA,Anonymous,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"Review is for Neuro Progressive Care (NPU). Most of these patients are total care and/or have behavioral issues. Staffing calls for 4 techs for 40 patients but rarely do they have 4, usually 2 or more often than not one gets pulled to be a sitter. Four weeks into my contract I’ve had 5 patients once, most of the time it’s 1:4, but it happens every now and then. Most of the time nurses are getting their own vitals and blood sugars, refilling pt. water pitchers, and sometimes changing their incontinent patients alone due to who is working. Due to the high acuity of these patients and back breaking work you put into taking care of them the teamwork on the unit is lacking. For instance, 90% of the time nurses will only answer call lights if it’s their own patient and no one else’s. The unit consists of about 80% travelers. There is always a free charge nurse, they call them OC’s here…sometimes 2 if you’re lucky. They do help out a lot when you have questions or problems. It’s common for nurses/techs to be late coming into work but their are no real consequences because they are desperate to keep all staff. It is a large 850 bed teaching/magnet hospital, which has its perks but also makes it very challenging to know who to call/page/secure chat to get in touch with one of the patients doctors.

Always staged with a free charge acuity is high but ratios are manageable 3-4:1 charge and ANMs would always check in on staff and come out of the office ready to assist passing meds getting vitals and even pulling sheaths when needed. PCU was a complete different story. Acuity high- med surg and ratios could be 5-8:1 occasionally higher at 10 Patients on night shift. They rarely ever had a free charge. Mostly charge had 7 patients with an LPN. All the staff were so overwhelmed there was not enough assistance on the floor when needed.

Assigned to a unit upon hire but float throughout the hospital (Orlando Health has now decided to float nurses throughout the entire hospital system--not cool) They have a large behavioral health unit that they will float you to unless you put in your contract that you do not want to float to that area. Small suburban hospital with a observation unit, PCU, ICU (small), M/S and a Surgical unit which is pretty much a princess unit as they only take certain patients, no infectious patients, and will sit at a census of 7 while the rest of the hospital has a list of patients in the ER waiting for a bed. Very rarely worked the unit I was hired for. Had one day of orientation to the floor and then on my own. You do not get report on your ER admissions and are expected to ""look them up"" in the computer (in your spare time!!!!). No heads up, they just show up to the floor. Ratio 1-4/5 in PCU, 1-5/6 on M/S and Surgical Floor. Obs unit is usually 1-4/5. Overall not a bad place to work, but will be glad when my contract is done. :)",Scrubster,"November 16, 2021"

Which to a traveler, we know that part of becoming a traveler is you’re more than likely to be the first to go if the floor needs to float someone. However, it’s not so much as the float itself, but the policy. Throughout my 13 weeks here, I was floated more than a dozen times, that’s more than a third of my contract. They also employ international travelers, but the facility doesn’t recognize them as travelers, but as permanent staff thus you are more likely to float.

Owensboro Health Regional Hospital,Owensboro,KY,Anonymous,4,4,3,3,2,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"As a seasoned travel nurse, I approach each assignment with optimism and an eagerness to contribute my skills and knowledge. However, my recent experience at a facility, which I had expected to be a pulmonary stepdown unit, turned out to be markedly different from what was initially presented. This review aims to provide an honest and detailed account for fellow travel nurses considering future assignments. **Expectation vs. Reality:** The contract portrayed the assignment as a pulmonary stepdown unit with a manageable patient-nurse ratio of 1:4, scaling up to 1:6 for lower acuity cases. In reality, the standard ratio was consistently 1:6, encompassing a tele/med-surg patient population. This discrepancy significantly impacted the workload and the nature of the care required. **Physician Interaction:** A critical aspect of any nursing role is the relationship and communication with physicians. Unfortunately, the nocturnists at this facility were notably unresponsive and non-communicative, making it challenging to secure timely orders and ensure optimal patient care. **Facility Conditions:** On a positive note, the hospital's cleanliness was commendable. However, this was overshadowed by a severe shortage of essential supplies. This lack of resources not only added stress to the nursing tasks but also raised concerns about the ability to deliver quality patient care. **Staffing and Support:** The staffing situation was alarming. The facility consistently operated with inadequate staffing, often lacking essential safety sitters or CNAs/techs. This shortfall placed an additional burden on the nursing staff, impacting both the quality of patient care and the work environment. **Team Dynamics:** A silver lining in this experience was the nursing staff, who were genuinely nice and supportive. Their camaraderie in challenging circumstances was a testament to their professionalism and dedication. **Overall Impression:** Despite the positive aspects, the stark contrast between the contract's portrayal and the actual conditions, combined with poor physician interactions and systemic issues, compels me to advise caution. For fellow travel nurses seeking assignments that align with their professional expectations and provide a supportive work environment, this facility may not be the ideal choice. **Rating:** Considering all factors, I rate this travel nursing assignment 2.5 out of 5. The experience was a stark reminder of the importance of thoroughly vetting potential assignments and being prepared for discrepancies between what is promised and the reality on the ground.",Scrubster,"November 29, 2023"

Staff was traveler-friendly, save for one ICU nurse but she left not too long after I started. Ratios are 1:5-6. The hospital is small, about 48 inpatient beds. Their MS unit on the second floor is attached to their tiny ICU unit. The ICU unit functions more like a stepdown unit. The second MS unit is on the third floor and usually where they keep the more aggressive and confused patients, ratio there was usually 6 patients. At the time they had a policy where restraints were not allowed on MS units; I'm not sure if the policy has changed in 2022. I would have stayed longer if management didn't start cracking down on mandatory bedside shift report on COVID patients..",Scrubster,"July 17, 2022"
"Pender Memorial Hospital, Inc.",Burgaw,NC,Anonymous,5,5,5,5,5,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"This was one of my favorite hospitals to work for! It is a small, 11-bed ER with one physician on hand. This can be good or bad, I suppose, but allows for great 1-1 interaction and a community feel. The staff, for the most part, are wonderful and there are better people than not that help you out and genuinely care. The area is close to Wilmington, where I lived for the duration of my contract. There are stunning beaches, shops, restaurants, parks, and entertainment. The only con is that admitted patients that require a specialized floor are often waiting days for transport to the larger sister hospital, New Hanover Regional. This means there are some inpatient/med-surg requirements and patients can get quite angry at waiting, understandably. I am not sure if this has changed since I've been gone over 1 year ago.

Then they wonder why you’re not freaking out like they are. If a patient needs to be tubed they send them up the road to banner. Lol kind of weird. In the IHS system it is almost impossible to get fired so it’s kind of like the dmv where you don’t have to try, so some of the staff were kind of lazy and they get away with it. The charting system on IHS hospitals is basically a free text blank progress note you can copypasta if no changes. That was also weird. But wasn't time consuming. The aides hand write your vitals down on paper lol. The cafeteria food is government subsidized so it’s super cheap for a huge meal with like five sides.

You will get 1 to 2 days of orientation on the floor, then you will be out on your own. How helpful the staff is, is dependent on which rotation you are working with. On one rotation the other nurses are helpful and the aides are very good. If you are with the other then you will not get much help and the aides are terrible. Most of the doctors are good to work with, the ones we have left anyways. Many have left over the past few months. This is speaking from a night shift perspective. You will have to work 4x12s the do not offer anything else and will not budge from this. The majority of the nurses have less than 3 years experience, many of the older ones have left recently. Being a traveler here, you will float to other floors and normally you will be first to get a admit if you have an open bed. Travelers do not seem to get floated too much here, but it does happen on occasion. A big plus here is you will never get tripled, I have never seen anyone here tripled, staff or traveler. Other than getting first admit and the occasional float to medsurg, travelers get treated like everyone else. It is not a terrible place to work, but there is a lot that could be improved upon. Supplies are readily available most of the time, the important stuff anyway, sometimes have to run to another floor but not all the time. There are 3 ICU units here, which you could work on anyone of them. MICU, SICU, and an overflow floor that isnt always open. Even if you float to SICU, you will not get a fresh heart or CRRT as a traveler. They are a little heavy on the charting requirements here. Scrub color is Royal Blue.

Overly strict two nurse scanning rules for routine subcu heparin and insulin. This made it difficult to do our job because you either had to prescan everything in the med room where other nurses are handy during med collection, which I didn’t feel safe doing (I scan at bedside), or leave your patient in middle of a med pass and go find another nurse to scan with you, which meant roaming the halls waiting for someone, and made it impossible to complete your med pass on time or to spend much time with your patients. I saw one serious med mistake happen because of prescanning at this facility. It is intended to improve safety but actually creates a safety issue. 2. You have to scan patients armband every 2 hours (nurse and tech swap even and odd hours) for safety rounds. If they aren’t physically scanned, your safety round doesn’t count and is a mark against you. It’s unreasonable to scan sleeping patients every 2 hours at night and often wakes them up and frustrates them.",Scrubster,"January 19, 2021"

ICU was 8 bed (really 7) and housed PCU status patients, with the rare exception of an intubated patient. Mostly, it was PCU status ETOH and Heroin detox with related liver and pancreas involvement. Higher acuity were shipped out. No intensivists physically present at facility, they were all available via video conference. Hospitalists were writing ICU orders.

Presbyterian Hospital,Albuquerque,NM,Anonymous,3,3,3,3.5,4,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"Just as the review above, the units are 1:5 ratio for “step-down”, more like over glorified med-surg or patients who need ICU but are on this unit struggling to stay alive. Most of the staff is friendly, but not much helpful. The techs can’t do vitals and majority of them are found asleep in the break room (nightshift) and if you ask them for help they disappear. Travelers always get the admits, sometimes 2-3 in a shift. Will always have the toughest patient load. Drugs are a major issue, have had patients smoke fentanyl in their room and get caught with it and also inject heroin while admitted that they brought in. Security does not search these people in the ER prior to admission if they are admitted for any withdrawal and even admit to having drugs on them. I’ve been abused by patients/assaulted more at this hospital than I have in my entire career. The area is also very much not safe, it’s in the roughest part of ABQ.

It is seperate from the hospital. I arrived the Saturday before my contract was to begin. I arrived Monday morning as first day instructions asked at 430. I figured they would have me with a tech.( No problem) When I get to the facility, it is an outpatient clinic. Outpatient runs totally different from Acutes.( I have worked both) Okay. No worries, lets make the best of it! The first thing the educator tells me on introduction is ""I don't know nothing about acutes, I dont know why they sent you here with me"" 😳😳😳 Really again I am 100% glass half full! I respond well lets make the best of it! I sat for 12 hours and only set up 1 machine, tested a D 6 meter and set up my email. This lady had no clue! Any question I had pertaining to the unit, she could not answer. She referred me to my manager on arrival to acute unit.. Okay, so that was Monday. Tuesday off Wednesday off Thursday, I report to the hospital at 0730 for my assigned 0800 shift. Its a huge facility. On arrival to the unit, they are clearly overwelhmed, under staffed and the nurses whom are present are under qualified.( scary) The nurse whom I am assigned to work with is not present just yet. By 0900 my assigned nurse still is not present, the CN calls her and wakes her up. She arrives at 11 am for her shift. I begin what we will call orientation. I watched as she took a PD, set up a machine and provided very, very detailed information on dialysis. ( I am a 6 year experienced dialysis nurse)😂 Middle of the day arrives and we get 4 add ons in addition to the already assigned patients. My trainer tells me I'm gonna have to do a patient. No worries, glass half full. ( we left at 1 am this night) That Friday we arrived early for a busy schedule of patients. ( 0600) on arrival I have 2 assigned patients, a PD to take off and put on and be a runner in between. Mind you, I don't have puss access, epic access, a badge to let me into units nor do I know where to go! I politely remind the trainer of all this, she tells me, we have to worry about that later, patients first! ( how🤷🤷) no worries, glass half full. I find my way to the other side of the building( the towers as they call them) by asking staff and reading signs. The hospital staff is very friendly on the units. We make it through the day and work the following Saturday. That Saturday I have 2 patients assigned, cool. I arrive at 8 and start early. Halfway through my first bedaide, I receive a text from the CN. We have a SLED that needs to be set up. She informs me I meed to set this up after my patient is done. Okay cool, hlass half full! I finish my patient, chart, disinfect etc. Inget to tue storage room to get a machine, the machine clearly has not been wiped down and the last disinfection was the 10. The day was May 15. So to put this patient on I must disinfect first😳😤😤 Cool, glass half full. Disinfection done. I get tonthe room set up and the machine won't pass testing and when it finally does it starts to give all sorts of crazy alarms. So I call the CN and tell her she or someone else needs to set up. By now its 8pm and I meed to start my next treatment. She gets angry and says there is no one else. Okay. I turn machine off to revoit it, rinse again and then start patient. Fine👿👿 I get to my second patient at 2130. He starts at 2200 and TX ends at 0240. I get home at 0400 after all that. The rest of the staff is gone. Glass is still half full! ( 18 hour days everyday) Breaks are a limited. As is communication from dialysis management to the staff. I have 62 hours on my orientation week This is what gets me. On Monday the manager sends a text stating she is coming over to the unit to help me get set up. She never Arrives. Soon after I get a text from her saying to call her to discuss why I have so many hours, I lost it! I sent a detailed text and copied my recruiter and HR person from my agency. At the end of the detailed and I mean detailed text I informed them all that moving forward I would do 36 hours ONLY! That Tuesday management was there personally getting my badge done, pysis access and epic access completed. I wasn't even in the system. Shady as all get out. Only reason they are trying to kiss ass is because I know all modalities and they need me to stay. They had the expectation to get me to extend. Offered more money, nope, I think not!

They did tell us a homeless encampment had been moved off site fairly recently and said that helped with parking lot safety concerns. I never had an issue. I was day shift. My biggest issues stemmed from the amount of times I was floated. 3/4 shifts I was on another unit. I think I worked on every unit in that hospital. The unit manager seemed to be off the unit as much as possible, never stepping in to help. Ratios were wildly unpredictable. One day I had 3 patients with a resource RN...some days I would have 6 with no CNA. Definitely not worth the pay I was making- the same if not less than staff.

I was there during winter months and staff was low census’d pretty much every single night we were there, including travelers. Always got my break. They staff their techs very heavily and they go through an extensive training process and are very helpful. Phlebotomy in ED. Level 2 trauma center that serves a 500-mile-ish radius for trauma. Large amount of psych, alcohol abuse, and trauma. Dedicated psych area with 4 beds, each with cameras and security seated outside watching cameras at all times. They also have a psych facility that they send nearly all patients too so very easy to get them accepted quickly and out of the ER. They also have a detox center that can be utilized for ETOH patients on discharge as well as what they call “safe bed” for patients to sleep at overnight on discharge. Security transports these patients and psych on discharge quickly so no real wait time on that. Scrubs are no longer provided to ED staff and you must bring your own. Managers are wonderful. They are very traveler friendly. Many things to do outdoors during warmer months, but the majority of Rapid City shuts down by like 10pm (in the winter atleast) so there’s really not a ton to do in winter besides snowboarding/skiing imo.

Management is visible on days, but they don’t seem to interact much with the travelers. They will hire without an interview. You won’t have to float to medsurg, but you will be floated to PCU (which is 1:4???). ICU is 1:2 unless they are downgraded patients. No computers in the room in ICU. You’ll work from a wow and sit in the hallway. No dialysis or cardiac pumps. Minimal vasopressors. Fairly easy assignments overall, but PCU can be very very busy. Cerner for charting, omnicell, plum smart pumps. Small town area. Restaurants only open for the weekends usually. But near skiing and killington.",Scrubster,"December 4, 2022"

Sacred Heart Medical Center Riverbend,Springfield,OR,Anonymous,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"This was my first contract and I loved this area. It is the most beautiful place I have ever been. The hospital is new and the ER is huge. The layout in the ER is kind of strange and depending on what rooms you’re assigned to, you may be far away from certain resources which sometimes was frustrating. I always felt like I had help if I needed it. On every shift you get a paid 15 minute break and a 45 minute lunch break. These shifts were long and hard, but they went by fast. The nurses at this emergency room are so awesome, but I had problems with several of the doctors. All the male doctors are great, but there were three female doctors that made my shifts extremely difficult and stressful every time I worked with them. The rest of the female docs were absolutely amazing though. My patient ratio was 2-4. 4 rooms if you are in the psych hall, 3 in the medical halls, 2 in the trauma/cardiac/stroke hall. There are a lot of boarding patients. The average waiting room time was between 4-17hrs on my shifts. There were sometimes 30-40 patients in the waiting room. This is a extremely busy emergency room but overall I had a good experience.",Scrubster,"January 12, 2023"
Sacred Heart Medical Center Riverbend,Springfield,OR,Anonymous,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"I was in the SICU/MICU here. Pros: You always get your breaks as they have meal & break nurses that watch your patients for you, they never practice out of ratio even for breaks. You get a total of 2 30 mins and a 15 min break, although I never really had say when I got to take them. They also have resource nurses that will take your patients to CT/Imaging studies for you and help you with other tasks. The physicians are great. The intensivists are in house even at night time and usually can be found on the unit. I always got timely responses, they were very proactive, respectful, honestly some of the best doctors I have ever worked with. Great ancillary staff: Phlebotomy, CNA's, RT's, Resource RN's, and Meal & breaks. Charges are not in an assignment. Cons: About half the ICU staff is kind and helpful and the other half is very rude/judgy and condescending to travelers. A lot of their staff has only ever worked at this one place so often times if you ask a question about what their policy is regarding a certain topic or ask a question about how something gets done in their institution, they get defensive and are condescending towards you, they are just generally not open to the idea that things are not done the same way in every institution. Scheduling: Myself and many other travelers have experienced major issues with scheduling. The scheduler is nearly impossible to get ahold of and lacks any amount of flexibility for travelers. People that signed contracts for days or nights later found out that they have variable schedules (nights & days mixed). I have also heard from several travelers that they have switched their schedules last minute without telling them resulting in them not showing up when they were supposed to be working or showing up on a day they were not supposed to (although that did not happen to me personally. My biggest problem with the scheduling has been I am on nights and they schedule me to work almost every other day and a lot of the travelers have this type of schedule and it makes it impossible to enjoy your days off or convert back to have a semi normal life, it also makes me feel like I am always there. The management in general has been very nonresponsive. I submitted for an extension over two ago and originally, they told me that they would let me extend for 8 weeks, I told me recruiter I agreed to it, my recruiter and I have not heard anything since despite multiple attempts from my recruiter to reach out, so now I am at risk losing my housing and thus will not be renewing. Other travelers were offered extensions with as much as 4-800/per week pay cuts, yet when you look at the schedule there is >10 open shifts per day for the current schedule and the next one.",Scrubster,"September 2, 2022"

For the most part staff was friendly, but everybody was so busy nobody had time to help each other out. So it truly felt like you were alone when your patient was having problems. Supplies were often missing, equipment broken, and computers very slow so when you were having a busy day you would often be slowed down even more.

I never got floated to ER for ICU holds, but it was supposedly required that they send an ICU nurse to take ICU holds in the ER - just that most of the time we still did not have enough staffing even with travelers to make it happen every day, but it did happen. Floating to SD was not bad at all, 4 pt assignment. The ICU & SD manager was great, she was out there taking 3-patient total care covid ICU assignments with the rest of us in the worst of COVID times for us. Nice lady, approachable, and reasonable. No issue with her, I'd happily work for her again. Tenet is not the best, but this is not a bad hospital to work for as far as Tenet goes. There are some really good nurses on staff, and they were all very friendly. Acuity can be high. In the height of covid we even had 4 patient ""team nursing"" ICU assignments, but we were paired with very competent M/S nurses who did 100% of the tasks they were capable of - ADLs, hygiene, any meds that were not critical care/titrated, charted safetys, restraints, I&O, basically anything other than assessments and ICU procedural stuff.

Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital,Salinas,CA,Anonymous,3,4,2,5,3,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"Orientation was one week long and in hospital orientation 3 shifts. Most of the staff are amazing but there are a few that try to be the boss. Everybody that is staff tries to be the charge nurse even though we have one. No consistency and can be chaotic. No real support during codes, unless you have some staff nurses. Everybody else likes to come and see and then they leave. Some MDs are super approachable others not so much. You never truly know what’s going on with your patient because there’s no communication between you and the MD. Next thing you know your patient is getting admitted and you have no idea why. Super disorganized. During your 12 hour shift you can be reassigned up to three times, which ultimately gets annoying. Charting is Meditech and simple to use. A lot of the help that you get is from other traveled! This hospital is probably 10% staff and 90% travelers. One night one of the charges tried sending one of the travelers home because of the census, not realizing she was a traveler.

I did not get orientation to the floor at all, didn't even get shown where the restrooms were. It is a 5:1 ratio. There is a triage 24 hours a day who also takes fast-track rooms. The charge nurse is responsible for taking their own patient load as well. Doctors are very friendly, staff is thankful for help but the majority of them are travelers. Patient acuity is lower than anywhere that I've ever worked. Hospital has an entire floor shut down due to lack of staffing so med-surg holds always in the ER.

Some required an answering service. Never saw them respond to Rapids/Codes. A lot of care seemed to be centered around money, probably because their doctors are mostly private hospitalist groups. Management constantly barking up alllll the wrong trees (they’re your typical “update your whiteboards, and never see management work the floor, ” stereotype hospital.

They’re telemetry unit was always switching up patient assignments during my 3 days in a row. It was always 1:6. Frequently got the less pleasant patients, assignments not based on acuity but by room number, until an intolerable patient comes along then that rule is out the window. Techs would take care of vitals and labs, unless they were short staffed then you draw your own labs. Doctors nearly impossible to get ahold of. Some used pagers. Some used Epic Chat. Some required an answering service. Never saw them respond to Rapids/Codes. A lot of care seemed to be centered around money, probably because their doctors are mostly private hospitalist groups. Management constantly barking up alllll the wrong trees (they’re your typical “update your whiteboards, and never see management work the floor, ” stereotype hospital. Probably because their patient satisfaction score was like 48% hospital wide (with a a goal of 69.5%, I’ll never forget it because they mentioned it every single shift huddle, which always took an unnecessarily long 10-15 minutes).

No orientation in department, I had to beg for a phone number list, the nurse charts anesthesia items, and you get in trouble if you dare habe more than one min over 30 min turnover. They are vocal about how they let travlers go from the department. Surgeons are nice staff isn’t all that friendly. Orientation is 9 days and good luck understanding how they have set up epic. CVOR has to cover 2 hospitals 45 min apart with a 30 min call time to both hospitals. You can tel staff is over worked. There is a lot of SA’s and help from ancillary staff! That’s nice. However, overall it’s hard to work there. I’m not impressed. The pay was good for the usual spring time session where the hospitals are pulling back but it’s a NO from me to extend.

The ratio is three to one, but you’re taking all of your patients to radiology, walking your labs over because the tube station is always broken, cleaning the rooms because housekeeping doesn’t come to the ER, so it’s a heavy load even though it’s three to one. This is a very Nurse heavy workload area. There is a unit clerk, and that helps. The Charge nurse mainly wasn’t helpful.

Stanford Health Care,Palo Alto,CA,Anonymous,5,5,5,5,4.5,,,,,,Syndicated Review,The unit itself like administration and education are traveler friendly but the staff is not mostly due to a couple a bad apples not all the staff are like this. To put in perspective. They are the highest staff paying hospital in the country. They only hire staff through travelers so all of their staff used to be travelers and commute from the lower east coast to work their 6 days and fly home. There is a lot of chart checking like other nurses will go in and check your charting randomly and aren’t very nice about it. Some of the staff will be very childish like if they had a less than ideal encounter with a travel nurse after telling her something she was doing wrong etc the next time that traveler said anything the staff nurse would turn to the other staff nurse and say “did you hear something?” There are kinder ways to help out travelers that are new to the unit to chart the way it is expected. They have a mentality that if you want to be staff you will only be staff if the staff “lets you” “you will only work here if WE want you to work here” management sends out emails to staff to rate and review travelers. The staff is very entitled will openly ask administrators in the middle of pre shift huddle why the travelers get vacation days off when the staff has been there longer which is very awkward when 60% of your daily staffing is travelers and we are all standing right there. And they have had travelers have big med errors so some of the nurses are very skeptical of travelers. They let you do triage because they have a charge in triage. Some areas are heavier than others. They have a secluded psych area and you get breaks which is nice. Usually 3 nurses to 8 beds each nurse gets 4 patients and the 3rd floats and breaks.,Scrubster,"February 6, 2023"

Then you’re made to take 10-14 pts as a CNA which they call a resource but you’re really not because you can’t help with nursing task all you do is get vitals, change patients, and do anything the nurses ask. The first assignment I was always in ICU because the staff loved me so much and they’d call staffing to make sure I was sent to ICU. That’s why I went back but the 2nd round was the worst experience I’ve had so far. They also float you to IMCU with a ratio of 1:3 sometimes 1:4 it’s not bad the staff is amazing.

I worked crisis in their critical care float Pool. They call telemetry the same as critical care (PCU, IMCU, SSU). They are not the same so many nurses hired were not qualified to work and were moved to Med-Surg or canceled. They have very few CNAs and housekeepers and no sitters. RNs were working as CNAs and sitters often. Rooms would sit for shifts waiting to be cleaned because there were no housekeepers. The guard was deployed while I was there as housekeepers and screener because the hospital has no staff. The hospital has 4 locations and they have their own unions but utilize the same group of staff which is a problem if you are assigned to a different hospital. Some hospitals are 7-7 while others are 4-4. The hospitals that are 4-4 are 90 minutes away. You would get a call 2 hours before the shift started telling you that you were moved to a different location so instead of waking up at 6 the hospital was calling at 2 to tell you that you were assigned to work at 4 and you had to leave in 30 minutes to be on time. Their scheduling is awful. They frequently would float nurses between day and night shift and different facilities with different start times. It's unsafe. The schedulers have no clinical background so they don't understand that plugging in holes with bodies could lead to someone's death. The rooms all have bedside monitors. The floors are well stocked with isolation equipment/PPE, there are ipads in most rooms for patient use. It's a beautiful campus. The 4th floor was anti-traveler and would target travelers and get them fired just because. The remainder of the floors were very traveler friendly. It would be a hospital I would love to return to but with guarantees in my contract regarding shifts and hours. There was always extra shifts to pick up. I worked 6 days the entire contract I was there. Kelly the NM for IMCU was awesome. Monique the charge on PCU could easily be CNO she is hands down one of the greatest charges I have ever worked for. I have never seen someone who could spot a fire while it was just starting to kindle. Hands down she is awesome and made PCU a great floor.

Choose you own schedule and it’s 4 weeks at a time (gets released with maybe 2 weeks notice as a heads up) and you typically get the days you put in, maybe moved one or two. Charges don’t take patients (day charges love to be nit picky but love the night charges). Nurse educators are usually on every night to help out. I’d say overall, it was a good experience (and it was my first). Worth it for sure to experience Austin life! Oh and rent can be expensive, I rent a studio that’s pet friendly in south Austin for ~1800 a month! Didn’t make much of a profit living here but also made the most out of being here so I was spending more than normal! It’s roughly an 80 bed unit (medsurg/surg onc share) maybe 14 nurses (including charges) and 4 techs. Rarely floated to other units but can be and to other hospitals.",Scrubster,"February 23, 2024"

St. David's South Austin Medical Center,Austin,TX,Anonymous,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"This was my first travel assignment in January of 2021. Meditech charting was horrible that I honestly felt paper charting would have been better for communication and patient safety, as it is difficult to see anyone's charting before you. When I contacted meditech and the hospital about help transitioning from Epic, they said that this hospital has the oldest version of Meditech. Staff just told me I needed to lower my standards to avoid the frustration, and eventually I did (at least with charting things), but it's not safe. Nurses are also asked to be the ones to have patients sign consent. They have a print out of the all the common risks of certain procedures and that's what you give patients. I felt very uncomfortable with this when I first arrived, and when I would ask docs to come do consent with their patient, they would get upset. I even had a doctor yell at me at the nurses station. They have some really nice docs, but I'd say there are still a few ""old school"" ones who think nurses are there just to do their bidding. Narc counting and monitoring is also a huge thing at this location. Per staff, a nurse overdosed at the hospital in the past, but when the computers didn't work (which was not uncommon), and meds didn't get charted like they were supposed to, you'd get calls at home and get brought into the manager's office to be asked about that one oxy that you have to the patient in 30 three weeks ago. The staff nurses also are paid so poorly - most under $30/hr. If the hospital updated their technology, hired a few younger docs, and paid their staff well, I think they'd be in better shape.",Scrubster,"January 12, 2022"

I really loved all my coworkers and we all made a great team! The nurses and techs are underpaid though. I was able to increase my pay by working night shifts + doing the weekend program (extra $5 an hour) which was okay. The hospital would always short staff nurses and techs so they could save money. There had been several times where coworkers had offered to pick up an extra shift to help out but were denied. Night shift was usually 6 patients per nurse with only 1 PCT on the entire floor. Very unsafe and very stressful. It was hard to get everything done/finish charting and you could almost never have a 30 minute lunch break without interruptions.

St Davids Surgical Hospital A Campus Of North Austin Medical Ctr,Austin,TX,Anonymous,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,,,,,,Syndicated Review,"For L&D, charting is done mostly through CPN. The staff all use iMobile, so getting through to a doctor, midwife, or other RN is simple. You will need to provide your own navy blue scrubs as they don’t provide OR scrubs to change into (I think this is an HCA thing?). The other RNs you work with on the floor (bedside) are 99% amazing. There’s always that 1 that doesn’t seem helpful everywhere. And, speaking Spanish will be very helpful to you as there is a large number of Spanish speaking patients (which will appear as SSO on the chalkboard). Carmen, the educator, is amazing, as is Amy, the nightshift manager. They will go above and beyond to help you however they can. Now, for the cons- of which there are many. The majority of the charge RN’s are rude. They’ll never take a patient, they talk about the staff behind their backs, and they only seem to care about getting IOL’s in. There must be some financial incentive for them to clear the induction board because it doesn’t matter how busy the unit is, they’re calling more people. There is also no set way to reach them. A few want you to text them, one demands a phone call, and others don’t care either way. Seems like a little thing, but seeing as you cannot call for a delivery team or anesthesia on your own, you MUST call charge to them call them for you, it’s something they really ought to get a ‘policy’ on. The managers, aside from Amy, are also incredibly rude. They seem to have forgotten what it’s like to work bedside, and for a facility that uses as many travelers as they do, you’d think they would treat us a little better. As for patient ratios? You will always have 2. Doesn’t matter how busy they are, expect you will have 2. Their fave line is ‘well we do 950 deliveries a month’ when it comes to patient load, but with 29 labor rooms and 5 ORs, I’d sure hope they’d do that many! If there are 20 patients and 20 nurses, you might expect each to have 1, or close to it? No. 10 of you will be doubled, so the rest can be open ‘in case someone comes in’. And you will be one of those 10. The only time you are 1:1 is either a mag patient, or if someone is pushing. Then and only then will they split you. They also always have a charge nurse, a co-charge, and a team lead or 2 who DO NOT take patients. Ever. No matter what. The unit has great potential- they just have the worst possible culture and rude managers and the RNs running things are all basically brand new. The good ones, the experienced ones, they all leave. And I can absolutely understand why! If a contract comes along that is good money, and you can deal with working in an actual shizzz show for 13 weeks, go for it.

The doctors are so easy to work with and communicate professionally with the nurses. There were never long waiting times in the waiting room. I never saw more than 5 people in the waiting room at a time, and even then, that was a rarity. This wasn’t a super high paying contract, but because of the night shift crew, I would definitely come back here in the future, maybe even as a staff nurse. The night shift charge nurses made a huge difference on my shifts. They are so active and involved with helping take care of the nurses taking patients.

The staff in the ICUs are very helpful. Although a good portion of the staff are travelers, a lot of them have extended their contracts and honestly eventually become staff. I personally did extend as well. The downside is that they do float all their travelers. Near the end of my contract, we were getting floated every other shift and that could be on the floor or between different Swedish campuses (which can get confusing). This was due to low census in the neuro icu. Overall, would highly recommend as travel assignment here! Everyone is very friendly and welcoming!",Scrubster,"May 10, 2023"

The Christ Hospital Health Network,Liberty Township,OH,Anonymous,3,3,4,4,3,,,,,,• Emergency Room-Syndicated Review,"The manager of the ED is completely off her rocker. She canceled me the day after she saw me for the first time. (I have an alternative look, piercings, tattoos, etc.) Not only did she cancel me, she called me personally, 45 minutes before my shift started, to tell me she was canceling me for the following reasons: ‘Staff see the soles of your feet more than they see your face. You are missing timed labs. You abuse the techs. You’re always on your phone.’ And then proceeded to hang up on me. I was completely flabbergasted. 1. This particular hospital is the most popular in the Cincinnati area. Which means the Emergency Department is a revolving door and NO ONE has time to sit with their feet up. This statement BLEW my mind for many reasons…bc like….wtf. The only times I even had the chance to look at my phone was at lunch (which we did receive) and in the bathroom. Otherwise I was always behind with my tasks because the techs were all mostly new and not able to do much as far as tasks go. Which leads into my next point. My last day there, I hardly saw my tech. Literally. I asked him to do three things that day. One of which he didn’t do. The entire vibe of the staff was off. Some of them were super friendly. Others maintained that ‘clique’ mentality that you see in a lot of ED’s. At one point, several staff members were gathered near my patients rooms, laughing, talking loudly, watching tik toks, and being generally disruptive. Not a huge deal, but when it gets brought up that I’m the one who had that behavior, it’s worth mentioning. Two days after this happened, they finally reached out to my company to tell them that I REFUSE to do blood work on my patients, I sit with my feet propped up on the desk while playing on my phone, and I had attendance issues. Again. Wtf. It makes sense to me as to why the other travelers were ready to get out of there when they did. It all seemed very nice in the beginning for me, and the other travelers were ending their contracts and excited to do so. I’m glad that my trek through that labyrinth was abruptly ended. Additionally, the doctors were incredibly slow, and they would put their patients up for discharge and then put in orders that would take me an hour or more to complete. Like, fluids, IV meds, etc.. or, they would go up for discharge without getting results from the doc. I had several patients leave very angrily because the doc couldn’t spare a moment to come speak to the patient. Another doc discharged the patient, specifically asked me to get urine before they left, and then the doc left. Well, guess who had a UTI. Yup! You’ll get about 50 e learns on your first day, but if you try to complete them while you’re at work, staff evidently think you’re lazy. If you don’t discharge your patients right away, despite the orders, you’re lazy. If you ask the techs to do their jobs, you’re lazy. I was unable to clock in the entire time I was there. They couldn’t seem to fix it. I had access to the Pyxis and epic day 1 which was nice. They have a POC room where they do majority of their labs, which is strange. They use Baxter pumps. Triage doesn’t even give your patients a call light when they put the patient in their room. Definitely don’t hook them up to anything, or even ask them to change into a gown while they wait on the nurse to get into the room. The manager deleted my time card the second she cancelled me, so I wasn’t able to screen shot it and send it to my company. No one could figure out who was responsible for sending time cards, so I just did it every week. Nbd, but not ideal if you have to do it from home. There aren’t really nurses stations. You get a wow and a chair if you can find one. Which is also why I lol’d at the ‘feet on the desk’ comment. There’s no desk lol 10 years in emergency medicine, 8 years travel, and this is the first time I’ve been canceled and the reasons are insaneeeee. It’s some kind of facade. They seem nice in the beginning but give it a month and all of a sudden it’s very clear who is miserable and they will be rude to you. Just all around not a good time.

Thedacare Regional Medical Center Appleton Inc,Appleton,WI,Anonymous,3,2.5,4,2,1.5,,,,,,• Emergency Room-Syndicated Review,"If you want to get an idea of what kind of company Thedacare is, just google Thedacare suing Ascension and have a good read. I only worked in the ER for this contract so the review is based solely that. To start, this is a level 3 ER that feels as busy as a larger metro level 2. They don't take a lot of trauma but they see a lot of emergent cardiac patients mixed in with overwhelming amounts of urgent care. The ER has has 3 major sections/pods that dictate what general rooms you're responsible for. Staff consists of EMT/medics as ""techs"", LPNs, and RNs with 1-2 docs with some overlap and a midlevel or two (during the day). I was supposed to be straight nights without flex/rotating shifts and had to remind them numerous times I did not agree to working day shift and one day off was not enough to flip my sleep schedule. I had a week where i was scheduled a day shift Monday, night shift Tuesday, and day shift Thursday. The first major red flag for me was going an entire 6 hours without any face to face communication with a doctor. Triage runs from 1100-2300 and the charge nurse will make the call where to place the patient. No one will let you know they roomed a patient and will either sign you up for the patient without telling you, or will leave the patient in the room and just expect someone to sign up for them. Docs will sign up for patients pretty quickly (unless its an hour before shift change, and you'll have a AFIB RVR not seen for almost 40 minutes.......ya......) then thell go sit in their little secluded cubby area throw in orders and get mad if you don't acknowledge them/get them started after a few minutes....god forbid you're stuck up on the floor transporting a patient or in the room of another patient and havent had a chance to refresh Epic. Which brings up another point....when you transport a patient up to the floor, the HUC will give the floor a heads up, tell you what time you can go up, and will call up to let them know youre on the way. You're still going to get stuck up on the floor for 15+ minutes waiting for that nurse to show up. ER staff will tell you to just leave the patient in the room after 5 minutes...I'm sure thats safe right? Speaking of the floor staff....I've never seen as much hostility and unprofessionalism as I witnessed in this ER. The hospital uses ""verges"", their form of incident reports on everything. If you were supposed to bring the patient up at 1400 and you showed up at 1405 you'll get a verge. If you took the patient to CT for an inpatient order before taking them up to the floor....verged....but if you didn't do it then you're clearly lazy and are just making more work for the floor staff. During shift change one of the ER nurses stated they sent 7 verges out during their shift....it's absolutely nuts and just childish. Staff seem to be REALLY against having travelers around, to the point where its almost a hostile environment. My orientation was ""3 shifts"" but was really just a staff nurse sitting down while I struggled to find anything because they ""didn't know what to do for orientation with travelers because we're supposed to be experienced already"". Staff was pretty resistant to helping with anything outside of patient care. You could be down their pod flipping their rooms for them and they'd return the favor by sitting on their phones while you take a new admission and your recently discharged room will stay dirty. Nurses are responsible for all transport, cleaning anything short of an EVS nightmare, flipping beds, and stocking if you can find the time (which no one can because everyone is downing together). So if you like to be drowning every shift you work, if you like finding out you just got 2 back to back ambulances and a half triaged chest pain all within 5 minutes (because triage roomed one and didnt tell you, the charge nurse roomed one and didnt tell you, and then EMS rolled in and placed a Pt and no one got assigned so they just assumed you'd be able to pick up the patient) while you're up on the floor with your last admission.... and the concept of communication is just so beneath you....then this is the place for you. There's a reason this place is struggling so bad and there's a reason travel nurses are leaving after a few weeks.",Scrubster,"December 6, 2023"

The Heart Hospital At Deaconess Gateway Llc,Newburgh,IN,Anonymous,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,,,,,,• Intensive Care-Syndicated Review,"This goes for Deaconess Midtown in Evansville, IN (not on this site yet), Deaconess Gateway in Newburgh, IN and Deaconess Henderson in Henderson, KY: If you sign up to be an “ICU float pool” nurse, they put you on their “resource team” and they send you to multiple units across their hospitals, which is fine, however I was only oriented on one unit at a hospital they rarely send anyone on their resource team to. I did my one orientation shift there 5 weeks ago and have never been back. When I interviewed, I was told there is a possibility that I could be floated to their 2 step down units. I asked how often that might happen as my background is in ICU nursing and was told the unit was usually fully staffed with their permanent staff so it would be rare. I’ve been floated there 4 times so far but another traveler i started with was sent there 10 of 13 shifts before Deaconess cut our pay mid contract and she didnt renew. They clearly dont keep track of who they send where and how often. I was also told i would have block scheduling but that is not the case either. I emailed my admin contact twice to see about getting my schedule rearranged and then reached out via phone. They told me the dates i was wanting to work i wasnt even scheduled for, and in looking at my schedule, I saw it had been changed without my knowledge. It was changed again a week later, again without my knowledge so if you take a contract here double check your schedule every week. The fellow staff are generally pretty nice. I had a pretty bad shift on a unit early on because there was so much to learn and everything was different from my other hospital. A few of the nurses deliberately told me incorrect information or would chart things for me to show me how and then tell me i did it incorrectly. Since that shift however, I havent really had a bad experience. The upside of being on their resource team means that other nurses dont always know that you are an agency nurse so they arent rude to you because you’re a traveler. Will update as my contract finishes. I am about 6 weeks in to my 13 week contract.",Scrubster,"April 27, 2023"
The Heart Hospital At Deaconess Gateway Llc,Newburgh,IN,Anonymous,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,,,,,,• Med-Surg-Syndicated Review,"This is mainly for the hospital at midtown at Evansville IN. I am a traveler with eight years of experience. I mainly work in step down and PCU’s but their MedSurg ratios are 1 to 4 or five, which is pretty great ratio typically. They put their travelers in a Resource pool and text you every morning sometimes an hour before your shift or 15 minutes, where you will be which includes three different hospitals and up to a 40 minute drive. They are very understanding if you arrive late due to the fact you didn’t know where you were going. The hospital in Evansville is very disorganized. A couple of floors are mainly staffed by Travel nurses . Not all the time but a few times I ended up working with a very cliquey core staff (and “local” travelers) And a few of them even had very ugly, anti-traveler attitudes. There are a lot of faults and issues with other departments such as Pharmacy, but anything that goes wrong will always be blamed on the Nurse. There is no constructive criticism involved just straight punishments for the Nurses even if something is inadvertently their fault. There are no expectations or real responsibilities set for the supportive nursing staff. Sometimes they do their job and sometimes they do not just depends on their mood, if for some reason, some thing is missed, such as a vital sign or sugar check be prepared to take full responsibility. Be careful trying to form a professional relationship with any of the core staff, as they will smile to your face and stab you in the back. During my interview, I was told they had flexible scheduling, and usually honor any request, which was true for my first contract, which I referred to as the honeymoon period because after that, it seems like they made the schedule opposite of what I wanted. I’ve witnessed that they do tend to overhire at times and will cancel a large amount of travelers at once or try to run them off and I’ve even seen a couple get canceled for petty things. The MedSurg floors I were floated around, had very few working equipments such as vital sign machines, and EKG machines and they have a lot of problems with being in working order. The nourishment rooms where they store snacks and drinks for the patients were absolutely unclean and disgusting, seems the water filter was never cleaned with what seems as calcium buildup on the spout, refrigerator stinks, and they even has a soda sprayer that lays INSIDE the sink. At times very hard to find supplies as well. Even though the ratio was a good fit, there ware a few floors that didn’t split assignments based on acuity, so you may end up with a very sick group (while the core staff sits on their butt all day) and there will be no help for you until you call an MRT and at that point they wanna know why you didn’t say anything sooner and they play dumb as if you hadn’t been asking for help all day. Many times when I have paged the physicians, it took 3 to 4 times of paging to get a response Some of the physicians do not like it when you suggest treatments for your patients so be prepared for an attitude issue with some of them. Report passes like a kidney stone and sometimes you will be giving report to four or five different nurses. Report literally sometimes takes an hour or more. Apart from this, the area is very unsafe. I was lucky to have my husband traveling with me. I’ve never encountered a problem until Evansville, where I was aggressively followed in my car a couple of times. The area in Evansville Has a lot of drug problems, There have been people attacked in the parking lot, including Healthcare staff. They do have policeman as their security, but they are mainly in the parking lot, directing Healthcare staff to go park in the Employee parking garage, which is about a block away. Like I said, everyone is a nurse hater here even some of their own nurses. The only reason I had extended once was due to the flexible scheduling and the higher pay I had at the time, but I regretted it immediately after starting my second extension. I did not extend the third time, please learn from my mistake and do not work here especially if you are newer to traveling.",Scrubster,"July 11, 2024"

Hand off report is unreasonable, even if baby is feeder/grower you start hand off @ DOL 1. They expect you to chart in cerner and chart the same stuff on paper 2-3x. Staff will sit all shift and watch travelers run all night. Travelers and staff are all floated on a schedule, so travelers are not 1st to float.

Everyone came in on time and I always left at 7:30 am on the dot or earlier. NP/PAs on unit throughout the night, but depending who is covering, they may be sleeping and you’d have to feel “guilty” waking them up, not that it mattered. Made some great friends there but it can be cliquey. Be nice and helpful and you’ll be fine. Don’t gossip, this place tends to do a lot of that. When floating to the floors, Night Shift can get anywhere up to 10 patients and management / supervisors don’t care about patient or nurse safety. Some need an attitude adjustment. As an ICU nurse, they will still try to give you 10 med/Surg patients. Ratios did improve for a short time to 6-7 but not always. All that being said, I would go back.",Scrubster,"December 20, 2023"

If they do not like you (the nursing staff) they will not obtain lab work from the patient. Their attitude is like they are doing the nursing staff a favor by gracing us with their presence. So therefore if the Phlebotomy department does not complete their job it falls on the nurses to draw blood from the patients and send it to the lab.

Tristar Centennial Medical Center,Nashville,TN,Anonymous,3,3.5,4,1.5,3,,,,,,• Telemetry/Step-down-Syndicated Review,"Quick disclaimer: My contract was canceled after 2 weeks due to ""low census."" I am writing a review anyways in case it helps or answers questions for anyone else. That being said, please take it with a grain of salt as I was obviously not there for very long. I was assigned to night shift on a step down unit (6T) and ended up having a ratio of about 4-5 patients. It was usually manageable and we usually had techs as well. They would give you 3 patients if you had titratable cardiac drips. Pros included helpful/friendly staff and manageable (in my experience) patient assignments. They also had phlebotomy, rapid response, and an IV team who would come place an IV as long as you attempted first. Cons included frequent floating to med-surg, lack of proper onboarding/orientation, and lack of sufficient readily available supplies. It was also an HCA facility which I feel speaks for itself. Communication about my scheduled and first day instructions was also pretty poor. Onboarding during my first day was very clumsy. I could not log into anything, was late to an onboarding meeting because the unit charge wasn't aware it was happening (not her fault, more of a lack of communication on behalf of the onboarding team), and wasn't given a point of contact in case I had issues during my contract. It took me almost the entire 2 weeks to get my hands on a badge, and by then my 2 week contract had come to an end. There were a couple scheduled shifts I showed up for, but was not on their master schedule. As a result, I had to sit around and wait until about 8 or 9 until they could find somewhere for me to float. When I did float, I had pretty good experiences with the staff. On more of a personal preference note, they use Meditech for charting which I HATED because it is so outdated. I felt like the staff on my unit and the units I floated to had a generally good attitude towards travelers. It was an okay place to work overall and I wouldn't have minded staying for the length of my contract.",Scrubster,"July 20, 2023"

So far I’ve been reprimanded for not having 2 discharges off of the floor within the hour of the order being put in regardless of the fact it was during morning med pass and put in within the same hour, a fall that happened within the first hour of my shift of a patient that had been there 24 days and didn’t have proper measures in place, then the answering of a question of a family member, the administration of a pain pill, oh and I must be struggling because I’m not seen on the floor enough….BECAUSE IM IN MY PATIENTS ROOMS PROVIDING CARE! They do not have a fully functioning cafeteria during the week and NO cafeteria on the weekend, the nurse is responsible for discharges, vitals, FSBS, wound care, then everyday nursing duties.

Floated to other telemetry, obs, and med-surg often for my first 4hrs without orientation, ratios 1:3 or 1:4 (some had up to 1:6 on nights in med-surg which I luckily avoided). Even floated me to spinal surgery recovery, basically just needed bodies regardless of specialty. Only received a few assignments that were actually CVICU/critical care. Staff was wonderfully nice and sympathetic to all the misled CVICU nurses. Most physicians responsive to concerns. Seemed as if over half of the nurses there were travelers though.

United Hospital,St Paul,MN,Anonymous,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,,,,,,RN/BSN • Telemetry/Step-down-Syndicated Review,"Worked on the telemetry unit; keep in mind this is now more MS/tele than actually telemetry. You have drips but aren’t able to titrate, any patient requiring titration gets transferred to IMC. Staff were friendly though there are a few older staff that are jaded/rude towards travelers, but you can easily pick out who these nurses are. Mainly travelers, unit overall is older and the patient population isn’t terrible. Ratios 1:3-4 on days, 1:4 on nights. They have plenty of resources available such as tele RN, unit RN resource, house RN resource. Charge does not take assignments. CNAs are short-staffed, more so than RNs so often you’ll be primary for all of your patients. Allina (hospital-system) is attempting to phase out travelers so no extensions offered and they cut the rate to $24/hr halfway through.",Scrubster,"August 6, 2023"
United Hospital,St Paul,MN,Anonymous,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,,,,,,• Intensive Care-Syndicated Review,"Took the assignment under the guise of the unit being a full-blown CVICU. Certainly wasn’t. There were 6 beds on the floor that qualified for “CVICU” where fresh post-op hearts were placed. Nearly all hearts were stable, no devices, and turned to telemetry by POD 1. The rest of the unit was 33 beds of a mixture MS/Tele/PCU. No clear guidelines on what made a patient Tele v Stepdown. Lots of confusing rules and policies. RNs are not allowed to start IVs, do phlebotomy, get EKGs… odd for a cardiac unit. Nurses were generally very nice and understanding about the travelers’ frustrations relating to taking a tele contract and expecting an ICU one. During my time it was decided by administration to cut all traveler contracts by mid August which the staff was very upset about. Any given night it was typically 80% travelers. Docs are awesome, staff are super friendly. Phlebotomy was slow but nice. IV team would fight you on getting new IVs. Usually had a resource nurse on each unit + free charge + float resource nurses for the hospital + rapid team so always had plenty of help. Older monitors and equipment but felt decent. I’d go back.

Down side is- you will get floated somewhere and anytime during your shift. Happens not only to travelers but to their own staff as well. Senior nurses are snab to travelers and not so approachable especially during handoff and if they can look for anything that would make you look incapable they would.

University Hospital And Clinics - The University Of Mississippi Medical Center,Jackson,MS,Anonymous,3.5,3.5,3,5,5,,,,,,COVID MICU Travel RN • Intensive Care-Syndicated Review,"Level 1 trauma, teaching hospital, ~700 beds, highest acuity hospital in the state. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU AREN’T USED TO EXTREMELY SICK PATIENTS! Fair warning! Epic charting, Alaris pumps, wear any scrub color you want. Overall, I have enjoyed my experience here and consider it one of the better places I have worked in terms of safety and resources, and I also enjoy sicker patients. But like most places I do still have some complaints. Pros: - NO 3 PATIENT ASSIGNMENTS!!!!! THEY JUST DON’T DO IT! - Manager is really nice, not overbearing, very understanding woman. I really like her. - The beds are mostly stryker icu beds with turning and pressure redistribution functions. - Facility is pretty nice - Very restricted visitation and phone call times :) only 4 hours a day for non-covid and convalescent patients and it’s kind of in the middle of the day, 10-2pm. - - No visitors at night unless a patient is dying. - Doctors actually obtain their own consents! You do not have to make any calls for consents!! - There is a critical care transport team consisting of an ICU RN and RT who will bring your patients to procedures, to radiology, wherever as long as they are vented. Not ALWAYS available because they also double as rapid response, so if they are busy with a rapid they might not be able to come for a stat CT. But for scheduled stuff they are great and sometimes they are available on the fly. - The residents are the prone team (you read that right!) - There are usually one or two staff nurses acting as a resource nurse on the unit most shifts. - Every room in the ICU is negative pressure - Free parking across the street at the stadium lot. It takes about 7 min from me stepping out of my car to the moment I clock in. Not bad for a large facility. - CRRT machines are prismax and prismaflex. Most ICU pts who have AKI and require HD will be started on CRRT - nice to me because a lot of these people are too fragile and you just know they’re gonna try to code if you start em on HD. I personally like doing CRRT so to me this is a pro but not everyone may feel this way. - Most of your patients will have a quad lumen central line and an arterial line Cons: - There’s truly nothing to do in Jackson, it’s not an exciting place by any means. There’s some decent southern food but there’s not a lot of fun sightseeing to do on your off time. A few museums but that’s it. - I cannot figure out why housing/hotels cost so much here. It’s not the worst, doesnt compare to cali or NY, but if you want anyplace clean and safe to stay with a kitchen expect to pay at least $75/night and even then, that is kind of hard to find. I have stayed in quite a few seedy areas here with musty ass rooms that looked OK on airbnb.com and what not. I am blown away because I spent much less on housing when I stayed in a beautiful vacation town elsewhere!! Even the extended stay hotels were cheaper there!! I am paying about 2500/mo for a clean and safe rental. WOW - There is a lot of crime in Jackson, a lot of blighted areas. Feels comparable to cities like Memphis TN, St Louis MO - No CNAs in the ICU - Sometimes I felt that the residents and their attendings were not aggressive enough in their care. Waiting a bit too long to start CRRT when a patient has not made any urine for several days, clearly their kidneys aren’t getting any better, kind of throwing their hands up in certain situations more than a few times. Document document document is what I say! I will say to be fair some of their residents have been really excellent. I set my bar pretty low for residents because obviously they are still learning, but some of them are really good! Obviously this is a factor that will vary. If you’ve worked at a teaching hospital, you know how this goes. - A lot of the travelers, sometimes myself included, felt that staff was very unwelcoming at times. This is not true of all staff, some of them have been very sweet and helpful. This facility is not used to having travelers in general so I can’t blame em for being salty that someone is here making 4x or more what they make, but they are also doing very little work while we have been there. The staff nurses who are in the covid ICU are usually just a resource nurse, but they do not have any sort of specific tasks or duties set for them. So how helpful some of them are depends on who it is. Some of them are driven and don’t need to be asked to go around and stock supplies in rooms, stock the isolation carts, go around and ask nurses who needs help with what. Others just kind of sit around on their phone all day in a corner and don’t make it known that they are there to help. Personally I’ve been a resource nurse before and I always had duties assigned to me...make sure everybody is turned q2, assist with hygiene and call lights, help with blood sugars, etc. I think that because there is some animosity from staff to the travelers the travelers often feel like they do not want to ask the staff nurses for help. I have seen the staff nurses be very accusatory towards the travelers. I will say sometimes it’s very warranted but I think these things should be handled a little less publicly. I don’t think it’s cool to confront a nurse in front of a patient, family, or other nurses about something. Personally I am a keep to myself kind of person, but I found that as travelers we have all stuck together pretty nicely. But I have mostly gotten along very well with the staff. - Expectation is that all travelers be able to take CRRT patients. Even if you are not trained in it prior to this assignment. They do give you about an hour crash course on it on your first day, and frankly I think CRRT is very easy but I am biased because I already knew how to do it!! I will say no time like the present to learn, and these are the easier machines to learn on but I do see this leading to errors. If you are not comfortable with CRRT and don’t think its something you can handle on the fly like that, I’d steer clear. - Like any facility, there are at least a few stupid rules. Here, you cannot tube any stool samples, you cannot tube a urine sample if it’s the kind that is in a cup, you cannot tube covid swabs...and if you want a fresh covid swab they wont tube it to you either, you gotta walk to the lab to get some if your unit ran out!! Stupid. - The charting is also very repetitive. They use epic, and they do allow charting by exception but only in terms of the actual hours...you still have to chart no matter what on your 8, 12, and 4. So to me, that’s not true charting by exception. But for each of those charting times, you can chart by exception. And they do NOT have the copy/paste function in their version of epic!! - The rooms are pretty small - Everything is bigger in the south, patients included. I have taken care of extrmely morbidly obese >400lb people almost every day. There have been times I’ve noticed that the entire unit save for maybe one or two patients is >300lbs. They do have the nice turning bariatric beds available though. I am not saying this to fat shame, but warning that if you have a bad back know that coming down here absolutely does take a toll on your back and you need to be careful. It can be frustrating at times when a task as simple as cleaning up a BM requires 4 people, and there is no CNA. - RNs draw and run ABGs in the ICU. Which for the most part, patients have an a-line which is convenient. But sometimes they don’t, and you will be expected to stick em. It’s not been a hard skill to learn but can be a little daunting...in most places, RTs do that job. Every place I have ever worked prior to here has RTs doing ABGs. But I’m glad to have learned the skill. But it's still annoying to have that extra task.",Scrubster,"September 25, 2021"

The facility had original oil paintings on all the floors. El Paso has great restaurants, amazing mountain lookout points to hike or drive to. Great downtown areas and museums to explore with bike or scooter rentals. I am considering going back here. The hospital is a level 1 trauma teaching hospital with lots of residents and nursing students coming through the halls.

I thought because it was like part of such a prestigious college that maybe it’d be a good experience. Here is a few things that happened during my experience at this facility -walk into shift @ 7:00, rapid called at 7:10 on pt by unit night shift RN (not primary RN of pt) i was to receive at I have yet to get report on patient i have yet to receive report from. Charge nurse berating and yelling at me to call report to SICU on patient. I tell her numerous times i know nothing about the patient (nighshift RN in another room). She then proceeds to tell me to get info from person recording rapid and give repot based off that?? Like what??? I don’t even know patients name. I attempt to find nightshift RN so that i could get some form of a report on this pt to give to SICU nurse. Charge nurse proceeds to follow me and continue to yell at me to just call and that I’m wasting time… Another day- same charge nurse tells travelers to give report on patient who has ALREADY expired and move to vitas unit so we don’t get billed for the patient??? have never heard of this in my life) Pts family had been there all day and was with patient through passing. Can you imagine telling a family of a patient you need to transport their deceased family member!?! How inappropriate Charge nurse was trying to give me two different patients on two totally opposite ends of the hall ( it’s a 40 person unit). One was on bipap- came in on night shift and was being bagged and the other was a three day prior MCA CVA in restraints who also was at risk for losing airway. I told her that’s unsafe and i did not feel comfortable and she proceeded to berate me and say I’m lazy??? Specific CNA nowhere to be found and management has team huddles about how if they are not around we are still responsible for q2 turning our patients. Ps most of these patients are totals (can’t tell you how many I’ve cleaned up on my own with no help). When i escalated my concerns to charge nurse and management was laughed at and told “don’t you know that this cna gets 4 hour lunches”. Meanwhile if the cna just so happens to be in room she will make it sound like she’s busy “stocking carts or about to check sugars” so she cannot assist. Same CNA on another day left my oriented patient sitting in stool for an hour after she canceled call light and did not tell me patient has had a BM. I walked in to patient in tears. It broke my heart. Charge nurses are fully aware and make jokes about this CNAs behavior. The list can go on forever…. these are just three specific days that i recall",Scrubster,"December 4, 2021"

University Of Missouri Health Care,Columbia,MO,Anonymous,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,,,,,,RN • Intensive Care-Syndicated Review,"The onboarding is the same as all permanent staff - so expect a full week of content that has absolutely zero bearing on you as a traveler, such as their health benefit plans. Block scheduling was part of our agreement (and my contract) but they did not honor that. My contract was ICU, but this didn't stop the vast majority of my time being on the medical-surgical floor where they were shocked I wouldn't accept six patients at a time. The floors take ""step down"" patients mixed in with the regular assignment, but their idea of ""step down"" includes things like titrateable drips or q15 minute checks to recover patients rather than PACU. They do not plan assignments based on acuity or workflow - they will change your assignment part way through the shift so you get to handle multiple discharges and admissions. It is a nightmare trying to figure out which physician you need to talk to, as physicians do not update the ""banner bar"" of who is the contact - if you call the wrong person they will simply yell at you; the hospital expects you to download an app onto your personal phone to ""text and send pictures"" to MDs or the chart, but will not tell you until you are actively taking patients (off orientation). Physicians routinely argue for nurses to do things outside of the nursing scope, and when you say no they will simply ask over and over or attempt to strong arm you into doing it anyway, such as an MDs will say ""yeah I'm good with pain meds"" then expect you to put in something under a verbal, or they expect a nurse to be able to do a swallow study (without speech) in a patient with a trach and several tracheal and eosophageal masses. MDs will push for unsafe discharges or demonstrate they do not know their patient (such as an MD expressing surprise that a patient had a known dementia, when it was listed in her history and admission note - I expressed that as a concern for the patient being discharged home without any assistance and this was brushed off as a ""non-issue""). Ratios are stretched - don't expect to be able to 1:1 patients that need to be 1:1, and don't expect a sitter to have any less than four patients to corral at a time. Patients routinely sexually harass or assault nursing staff - despite the title ix protocol, the general attitude of the PD in the region is ""you just asked for it.""",Scrubster,"April 27, 2022"

Poor culture of teamwork and collaboration between different disciplines. Patient care was at times very poor during urgent situations, as residents were unable to make decisions, and residents and physicians just stood outside the room and watched rather than acting on a patient's condition. Many of the patients who were on comfort measures were left alone to die (even though they have a ""no patient dies alone"" protocol).

Travelers float first (no biggie) but they will float their ICU travelers to med-surg floors so that their staff can float to the other ICUs. Travelers are not allowed badge access to Epic for the sole reason being that they’re travelers. The floors max you at 3 patients, but it is actual policy to give them the hardest three (since they’re ICU). I haven’t once spoken to the manager of our unit outside of a couple of emails. No management or administration even tried to introduce themselves. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful in the ICUs, but they frequently complain about travelers being there at all and “stealing their money”. Travelers are not allowed to take any devices on a patient no matter how many years of experience you have for them. You are not allowed to take anything but stable ICU patients. Also the hospital is aware that many travelers stipulate no floating to MS floors. So, they decided they don’t HAVE MS floors- they have ACUTE CARE floors. The medical teams are awesome.

"Usc Kenneth Norris, Jr. Cancer Hospital",Los Angeles,CA,Anonymous,5,5,5,5,5,,,,,,• Other-Syndicated Review,"1. Most shifts the traveler will be resource nurse which isn't bad most days but the position isn't rotated often depending on the specialized floor. 2. Scheduling is sometimes an issue. As a traveler you have to be flexible because you don't always get days off you want and 2/3 of staff aren't willing to trade days with you. 3. As per usual if you're not needed at your home unit you'll be first to float and flexed. They try to keep you for at least 6hr but I have had shifts were I got floated twice per shift. Since this hospital is a specialized and private hospital, the need is different than the average hospital with an ER. Unfortunately, I have been flexed too many hours so check with your agency how many is allowed so the facility does not exceed. I was flexed way too many times, I did not renew my contract. 4. Overall it was a pleasant location and staff are for the most part friendly to travelers. I would consider working here as staff if I permanently lived in the area. They have an amazing union with mandatory breaks (x3 15 min and x1 30min lunch), safe ratios, etc. Hope this helps this is my honest review.",Scrubster,"December 4, 2022"

Charge was free and occasionally would have a resource nurse. 1 sometimes 2 PCT for the 20 bed unit, 1 monitor tech on the floor watching the monitors. Biggest complaint would be the scheduler and onboarding. As travelers we would have last pick for our schedule and we only had 2 days whereas staff had 1 week to put in their schedule. Schedule was posted super last minute and I didn’t really feel like I would ever get the days I requested. Apparently this scheduler is the scheduler for the entire facility. Okay I understand, you have a lot on your plate but she would not block schedule us, or even give us the days we put in ourselves ( at that point why even let us put it in then???). Core staff was definitely first preference and from what I understand they always got the schedule they wanted. I get it were there to fill holes but at least block schedule us! Especially for night shift. Onboarding had a lot of modules, some you couldn’t really breeze through. I had trouble accessing Kronos for my punch ins and to put in my schedule.",Scrubster,"December 6, 2023"

The staff were very helpful to travelers and made us feel welcomed. Patient assignments were very appropriate and allowed me to spend a lot of time with my patients. They tend to give travelers the lower acuity assignments (so if you like high acuity this might not be the place for you) I give 4/5 stars because the last 4ish weeks of my contract I was always floating. If you work NICU you know it is a very specialized unit and floating elsewhere, unless you have previous experience in peds, can be very daunting and leave you feeling kind of lost. I will say they only had us take patients under 1 year, and when floating to the ED we were taskers and were not expected to take a patient assignment. Overall the entire staff hospital wide was very friendly to travelers and at least when I was floating had people constantly checking up on me to make sure I was okay. Raleigh is a great city and I did genuinely enjoy my time here with the exception of the last few weeks. After talking to many other travelers and staff though, the floating every shift is new (in the past month) and is not how things usually are here.

This place was literally being built from the ground up. About 20 pts per day with only two nurses.. The other nurse was a traveler. All staff there kept telling me they couldn't keep their nurses. NM used to tell me she would take care of this floor herself. NM told us that if we clocked out late, she was going to have to adjust our start time. Story of my experience - I was hired onto the outpatient infusion center clinic at this location. The NM interviewed me over the phone and asked if I had any experience infusing chemotherapy. I am originally from an inpatient med surg onc floor, so we hang chemo regularly, but not as often outpatient would have. Therefore, I explained this to her. NM also mentioned that travelers will need to help with regular floor activities such as restocking. I got the job. The NM was present for my first day then took a vacation for about two weeks. So I didnt see her my first week and towards the end of the 2nd week, she came back. She started to watch me and the other traveler more carefully as we were into the job for about 2 weeks now. She started to show us her way of doing things when we have been shown the way the other staff nurse has trained us.. She also mentioned that we needed to help with prescriptions, phone calls, and so much more. She wanted the travelers to do them in between patients but it was difficult because we needed to chart and plus chemo requires two nurses. The staff who trained me told me she never did any of those things. It was a small clinic but some days we see 20 patients. Then we were also expected to help with doctor appointments. The NM started talking to me and asking me about my experience with outpatient and I reminded her I had inpatient experience and that we hung chemo regularly but not as often as here. The NM seemed uneasy about it and told me ""it's okay. We will figure it out together."" I dont think anything of it because I'm pretty confident in chemo infusion. Towards the end of the week, I started to feel sick and let my NM know that. I told her I felt feverish, but maybe it was just allergies or the weather since I am new to this area. NM was fine with it and just me to watch my symptoms. That weekend, I tested positive for COVID. I immediately tell my NM and recruiter. My NM accused me of getting COVID from hanging out with my friends and demanded me to tell her where else I have been. She then told me to quarantine for 14 days.

Western Arizona Regional Medical Center,Bullhead City,AZ,Anonymous,3,2,3,-,-,,,,,,Registered Nurse • Intensive Care-Syndicated Review,"This is a regional small hospital in a small town. Keeping staff and maintaining staff was a major difficulty for this hospital due to very toxic leadership (CNO). This isn’t a secret, my first day there everyone told me to watch out for her, her toxicity knows no bounds. I’ve seen her lose her crap on a traveler for something the charge nurse and doctor told her to do on like her second week there, and she will go on witch hunts regularly. ICU acuity is fairly low, anything substantial gets sent to Prescott/vegas/Phoenix. Do not expect to have the same amenities and access to supplies that you would at a larger hospital in a bigger city. We were constantly scrounging around, going to cath lab for much needed supplies to adequately take care of our patients. Pharmacy is also very short staffed, so don’t expect anything that’s not in the omnicell on time, ever. The doctors do not communicate, and expect you to referee situations between them. It is a constant back and fourth between what each doctors want, and instead of communicating between each other they rather get frustrated with you instead. This lead to a delay of care on multiple occasions because the IM and hospitalists want to avoid stepping on surgery/cardio/nephros toes. ICU staff is very reluctant to trust travelers due to bad experiences with previous travel nurses, and the charge nurses have the “you’re going to earn that money” mentality. You’ll rarely come back to the same assignment because they will always change your assignment to the patients getting downgraded/transferred/discharged. They also force unnecessary downgrades to PCU status make sure that you’ll always be tripled. This is for staff too, not just travelers, everyone is always tripled. Always. Like I said, very poor staffing plagues this hospital. The ED staff staged stand ins multiple times while I was there because the staffing was so bad. The hospital does what it can with what it has, and I feel for the staff because they think this is okay and normal because they’ve never worked elsewhere and there’s no where else to really work in the area.

The oncology tower (med, heme, gyn, surg are all separate floors) is the best tower in the hospital as it's brand new. Traveling wise we were 3 hours or less from peak opportunities like NYC for Christmas, Salem for Halloween etc. Fall is the best time to be up there for sure. Cons: med surg is a third world country comparatively. No techs/aids. There were 4 patients to one room. It was night and day from the onc tower. The staff: everyone is friendly/helpful but they intentionally make unsafe/heavier assignments for travelers and have no problem telling you they do that. Surg onc is the exception. They love any and all help. The area is unsafe in general. There's so many police buttons and extra security everywhere you go but it doesn't stop the crime in the area even a little bit.

Yale-new Haven Hospital,New Haven,CT,Anonymous,3,4,2.5,3.5,4,,,,,,• Med-Surg-Syndicated Review,"Multiple points to be made… - I was originally hired for a unit that was not even open yet. The manager for that unit also managed two others. Therefore, I was supposed to be working on those two units until the other opened. However, 90% of my shifts were spent floating to other units. I was okay with it, but it’s something to keep in mind when working here. - On a lot of floors they have 3-patient cohorted rooms, with one bathroom in the room. Kind of gross if you think about it. Anyway, the problem with the 3-patient cohorted rooms was that they would have 3 confused patients in the same room. All are wanting to get out of bed. So, when one would wake up, they would wake up the other two. It essentially became a game of ping-pong on trying to get the patients back in bed to prevent falls. - the hospital is very understaffed (which is the normal now). However, a lot of days there was no tech, so the nurses ended up with 5 total-care patients with little-to-no help because everyone else was busy. -Certain floors don’t know how to balance assignments. There would always be one person drowning, regardless if you were staff or a traveler. Someone always got a horrific assignment. -The Epic charting software they use is very different from other epic programs I’ve used in the past. It took a few days to get the hang of it. -The hospital is not in a great area. You’d think since it’s associated with Yale University it would be in a nicer/safer neighborhood, but it’s definitely not. In the 3-month duration I worked here, the hospital underwent 4 lockdowns due to shootings in nearby streets. They do have a lot of security guards on the campus 24/7, so you feel a little safer. -you have to pay for parking. But the parking garage is right next to the hospital, so it’s not a far walk. -the only redeemable quality is that the core staff is very nice and welcoming. -providers are readily accessible. You can message them though your assigned phone and they respond fairly quickly. -if you’re working nights, the main cafeteria closes but they have a little cafe where you can get snacks, sandwiches, salads, chips, candy, or beverages (similar to a convenient store)",Scrubster,"February 18, 2023"

Yale-new Haven Hospital Saint Raphael Campus,New Haven,CT,Anonymous,4.5,4,3.5,5,5,,,,,,• Emergency Room-Syndicated Review,"Ratio was 1:6. They generally did a good job making 3 of those 6 patients a level 4/5 ESI. However, it is still a lot to manage if you’re not efficient. 3 of those patients are in rooms, the other 3 are in the hallway. St. Raphael’s campus is the sister campus down the street from the main campus. So, you’ll never get any trauma patients or see anyone overly sick unless they come through walk-in triage. Techs were generally helpful and the hospital has a lot of resources (transport, social work, ambulance triage nurse). I also felt like they did a good job rotating who gets the next patient. So, if you discharge 2 or 3, they’re not gonna slam you with 3 new patients back to back. They have A LOT of frequent flyers. Lots of sobriety holds who they cater to that sleep in the hallway for 12+ hours. ER attendings were overall easy to approach but experience was either hit or miss. Little bit of patience required with the newer residents. No one covers you for lunch, so it’s on you to “tidy up” your assignment. The staff nurses were mostly nice but it’s probably 75% travelers. New Haven isn’t really the best area, but you’re super close to NYC, Boston, Salem, etc. If this hospital could fix its patient ratios and mitigate how often the frequent flyers come in and abuse the system, this could be a pretty okay assignment.",Scrubster,"December 28, 2023"

I had to spend time from my day away from my patients to try and fix this multiples times. This was the beginning of the issues here.",Scrubster,"December 25, 2021"

Zachary - Amg Specialty Hospital,Zachary,LA,Anonymous,3,3,4,4,3,,,,,,• Other-Syndicated Review,LTAC - paper charts. 6:1 ratio. Outdated equipment. Shady management. Heavy load on nurse - total care pts and alot of wound care. Lazy/incompetent staff. Pts were left soiled and dirty too frequently. A lot of medical errors not handled properly by management. Felt like my license was in jeopardy there. The bad google reviews from pt’s and their family are true. Management had staff write fake google reviews to make them look good. Changed CNOs 3 times this year.,Scrubster,"December 8, 2022"
